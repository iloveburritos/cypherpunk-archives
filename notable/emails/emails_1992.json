If you receive this, its\nbecause \n\nMy friends, its rare of me to try to encourage panic. Occassionally,\nhowever, by panicing early we can avert a disaster later on.\n\nRisks, an internet mailing list, reported about a week ago on a\nproposal by Dr. Dorothy Denning, one of the most prominent people in\nthe field of cryptography, that copies of all private encryption keys\nassociated with public key cryptographic systems be held, effectively\nby the government, to permit them to read people's encrypted messages\nto each other. Naturally, such invasions of privacy will only be\npermitted \"when a warrant is produced\". It has been suggested that\nthis idea might be taken up by several government agencies for\n\"review\".\n\nMany have noted that the dawning of cheap and effective cryptographic\nsystems could spell the end of the ability of governments to invade\npeople's privacy. Unfortunately, it appears that the government and\nits cronies have also realized this, and intend to take preemptive\naction. Our notion of civil rights has decayed so far that it is now\nconsidered a citizen's duty to not merely be quiet while he is\nenslaved but to actively cooperate with his own enslavement. Not\nmerely must we put up with the indignity of the government being\ngranted the right to read our papers and communications to each other,\nnot merely has the FBI attempted to get legislation passed to make\nphone companies give them easier access to tap phone lines under color\nof \"maintaining the current capability in the presense of new\ntechnology\", but now it is suggested that we ordinary citizens must\npersonally cooperate to make it easier for them to read our\ncommunications. We will be branded criminals if we fail to cooperate,\npresuming that ideas like this are enacted.\n\nIt is crucial that the fiends proposing this be convinced that\nresistance will be too high to implement their plan. It is crucial\nthat before they can even propose legislation that the threat here be\nbrought to the attention of the news media. If the currently proposed\nFBI legislation were passed, a dictatorial government would have all\nthe tools it would need to tap all the phones in the country -- the\nonly thing restraining that behavior would be a system of warrants\nthat could disappear with a mere change in attitude. If Denning's more\nserious and sinister idea were proposed for future enactment as\nlegislation (this has not yet been proposed), it would become\nimpossible for individuals to take any action to protect their own\ncommunications privacy from a dictatorial regime, even ignoring the\nquestion of abuses that could occur right now. I'm convinced that the\nonly thing that prevented the FBI bill from passing this year was the\nfact that media attention was brought to bear. Its important that this\nnew proposal be exposed to similar sunshine. Far be it for me to\nsuggest restraint of free speech, but I would like to see people\nthink of making such suggestions as having the social acceptability of\ncalling a black person \"nigger\".\n\nHere, for reference, is a copy of an article Dr. Denning just posted\nto sci.crypt on usenet.\n\nI encourage people, rather than discussing this matter on libernet or\nextropians, to discuss this on sci.crypt where the topic is just\nbreaking.\n\nPerry Metzger\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArticle 6275 of sci.crypt:\nPath: shearson.com!uunet!uunet!think.com!sdd.hp.com!zaphod.mps.ohio-state.edu!darwin.sura.net!guvax.acc.georgetown.edu!denning\nFrom: denning@guvax.acc.georgetown.edu\nNewsgroups: sci.crypt\nSubject: Re: A Trial Balloon on Registered Keys\nMessage-ID: <1992Oct27.143737.1574@guvax.acc.georgetown.edu>\nDate: 27 Oct 92 14:37:37 -0500\nDistribution: world\nOrganization: Georgetown University\nLines: 94\n\nThe posting about the proposal I made at the NCSC for key registration\nis essentially correct.  Let me add to it the following:\n\n1.  The government is not taking any action to curb crypto and is \nunlikely to take any such action in the near future.  No proposal has\nbeen made and no government agency that I am aware of has plans to\nmake such a proposal. The closest we've had to a proposal was a \"Sense\nof Congress\" resolution in Senate Bill 266 over a year ago.  This \nwould not have mandated anything, but said it was the sense of \nCongress that service providers should provide accesss to the \nplaintext of encrypted communications under a court order.  It got a lot of \nopposition and was withdrawn.  Thus, don't panic folks -- this was just me\nmaking a suggestion.  I didn't realize I had that much clout to cause\nsuch a stir and call to arms!  I expect that the next step will be government \nsponsored discussions about crypto policy, probably sponsored by NIST,\nat the recommendation of the Computer System Security Advisory Board\nheaded by Willis Ware.  That will provide a forum to work through these \nissues.  \n\n2.  The reason I made the proposal is because I am concerned that we\nmay be facing a major crisis in law enforcement.  I expect many of\nyou will say \"that's wonderful\" but I don't see it that way.  \nElectronic surveillance has been an essential tool in preventing \nserious crimes such as terrorist attacks and destabilizing organized crime.\nThe economic benefits alone are estimated to be in the billions.  This\nissue is not about snooping on innocent citizens but about doing what\nwe can do prevent major crimes that could seriously disrupt other\nliberties.  The problem is likely to get even worse if criminals know\nthey use the telecommunications systems without any chance of getting\ncaught.\n\n3.  My proposal was to register your private key with a trustee, \ndifferent from the government.  The key would be encrypted under some\nother public key so the trustee couldn't decrypt it.  I have suggested\nit be the key of the DOJ, but it could be another independent trustee.\nI believe this would provide acceptably good protection since someone\nwould need to get a court order and then the cooperation of 3 agencies\nto get at your communications: the telecommunications provider (to get\nthe bit stream), the first trustee (to get the encrypted key), and\nthe second to decrypt it.  Experience with the telecom providers has\nbeen that they are very fussy about court orders -- you have to get\nthe semicolons right!\n\nYou can get even more security by using Silvio Micali's \"fair \npublic-key cryptosystem\" approach.  Called \"fair\" because it is \ndesigned to strike a balance between the needs of the Government and\nthose of the citizens.  With his approach, you would break your key\nup into 5 parts and give it to different trustees.  All 5 parts\nare needed to reassemble it, but it is possible to veryify the parts\nindividually and as a whole without putting them together -- \ningenious!  He presented this at CRYPTO '92. \n\n4.  Someone suggested that law enforcement routinely taps without\ncourt order.  This is an ungrounded claim for which I have never\nseen any evidence.  Regardless, their ability to do this is \ndisappearing with the new digital based technologies.  They need the\nhelp of the service providers, who in turn ask for court orders.\nCourt orders are not all that easy to get as law enforcers have to\ndocument why other approaches have failed etc.\n\n5.  Many people have noted that you could not enforce key \nregistration.  They may be right, but I am not throwing in the towel\nyet.  Let's take phones, which is what law enforcers are most \ninterested in.  Products are emerging that you can attach to your\nphone and that will do DES encryption.  Criminals and everyone\nelse are most likely to use commercial products -- easiest to\nget and cheapest.  The products could be designed so key registration\nwould essentially be part of the sales process.\n\nThere can be social benefit to government regulation even when \nregulation is not 100% successful.  None of our laws prevent the\nacts they outlaw.  But this does not mean we should get rid of\nall laws.  \n\n6.  Some people have said we should not give up our privacy to the\ngovernment.  But the constitution does not give us absolute privacy.\nWe are protected from unreasonable searches and seizures, but not\nreasonable ones in response to \"probable cause\" of crime.  In all\nareas of our lives, the government can invade our privacy if they\nhave good reason to believe we are engaged in major criminal activity.\nThey can break into our homes, our safes, and so on.  Do we really\nwant a society where electronic communications cannot ever be broken\nwhen there is good reason to believe some major threat against society\nis being planned?  \n\nThank you for your comments and for encouraging those on the other\nnews groups to move over to sci.crypt.  I'll try to keep up with\nthis newsgroup and respond to other comments if appropriate, but\nI honestly can't track them all.\n\nDorothy Denning\ndenning@cs.georgetown.edu (posting from guvax)\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------", "body_length": 9170, "has_pgp": false, "flags": [], "parent_id": null, "children_ids": [], "is_thread_root": true, "orphan_status": "true_root", "normalized_subject": "threat to our privacy", "thread_id": "thread_bf4674d202a03a3e"}, {"id": "cee11211066407cd", "year": 1992, "source_file": "cyp-1992.txt", "line_number": 39057, "from_raw": "tribble@xanadu.com (E.

From San Francisco, it's about a\n40-minute drive.  Get off at the Rengstorff Ave/Amphitheatre Parkway\nexit.  If you were heading south on 101, you curve around to the\nright, cross over the freeway, and get to a stoplight.  If you were\nheading north on 101, you just come right off the exit to the\nstoplight.  The light is the intersection of Amphitheatre and\nCharleston Rd.  Take a right on Charleston; there's a right-turn-only\nlane.\n\nFollow Charleston for a short distance.  You'll pass the\nMetaphor/Kaleida buildings on the right.  At a clump of palm trees and\na \"Landmark Deli\" sign, you can take a right into Landings Drive; this\ngets you into the complex from the north.  Or you can go slightly\nfurther along Charleston and take the next right, into a driveway with\na big \"Landmark\" sign in the middle.  No matter which way you got into\nthe complex, follow around it until you are on the side that faces the\nfreeway.  There's a clock tower that rises out of one of the\nbuildings, to the right (south) of the deli.  Enter through the doors\nimmediately under the clock tower.  They'll be open between noon and\n1PM at least.  (See below if you're late.)\n\nOnce inside, take the stairs up, immediately to your right.  At the top\nof the stairs, turn right past the treetops, and we'll be in 1937 on \nyour left.\n\nIf you are late and the door under the clock tower is locked, you can\ngo to the deli (which will be around a building and left, as you face\nthe door), cut between the buildings to the right of the deli, and\ninto the back lawns between the complex and the farm behind it.  Walk\naround the buildings until you see a satellite dish in the lawn.  Go\nup the stairs next to the dish, which are the back stairs into the\nCygnus office space.  We'll prop the door (or you can bang on it if we\nforget).\n\nOr, you can find the guard who's wandering around the complex, who\nknows there's a meeting happening and will let you in.  They can be\nbeeped at 965 5250, though you'll have trouble finding a phone.\n\nDon't forget to eat first, or bring food at noon!  I recommend hitting\nthe burrito place on Rengstorff (La Costen~a) at about 11:45.  To get\nthere, when you get off 101, take Rengstorff (toward the hills) rather\nthan Amphitheatre (toward the bay).  Follow it about ten blocks until\nthe major intersection at Middlefield Road.  La Costen~a is the store\non your left at the corner.  You can turn left into the narrow lane\nbehind the store, which leads to a parking lot, and enter by the front\ndoor, which faces the intersection.  To get to the meeting from there,\njust retrace your route on Rengstorff, go straight over the freeway,\nand turn right at the stoplight onto Charleston; see above.\n\nSee you there!\n\n\tJohn Gilmore", "body_length": 2962, "has_pgp": false, "flags": [], "parent_id": null, "children_ids": ["2889.2AD73B41@fidogate.FIDONET.ORG"], "is_thread_root": true, "orphan_status": "true_root", "normalized_subject": "better directions to the meeting on saturday at noon", "thread_id": "thread_c91b820aa781923c"}, {"id": "7b783bab3e80b537", "year": 1992, "source_file": "cyp-1992.txt", "line_number": 816, "from_raw": "pozar@kumr.lns.com (Tim Pozar)", "from_name": "Tim Pozar", "from_email": "pozar@kumr.lns.com", "date_raw": "Thu, 24 Sep 92 10:28:07 PDT", "date_parsed": "1992-09-24T10:28:07-07:00", "subject": "Re: KPFA interview went well", "message_id": "m0mXwxx-00029lC@kumr.lns.com", "in_reply_to": "9209232007.AA03117@netcom.com", "references": [], "to": "tcmay@netcom.com (Timothy C.

I want to call it the \"Rander box\" for\nlack of a better name.\n\n   It will have two serial connectors,   one an input,  and other the\noutput,   and connect to a modem or serial port.   Physically,  it should\nhave dip switch to select baud rate,   and an on-off switch.\n\n   When switched on,   and a \"cr\" (or some other character) is sent to it,\nrandom bytes will stream out continiously.   Another \"cr\" will stop the\nbyte stream.    At least this is ONE approach.   If anyone can think of\na better way,  Pse speak up.\n\n   Next week,  I plan on consulting with another hardware guru and\nformulate an initial design.    I already know what components need\nto go into it,   and now I want to try and eliminate an extra UART if\nI can figure out how to turn on and off the random stream via software.\n\n   The internal code of PGP (I am told) uses an internal buffer to hold\nthe random bytes,  generated my environmental changes such as key strokes,\nmouse movements,  or other external actions.\n\n   Some of the Mac implementors are discussing the feasability of not\nmaintaining 100% portability.   I suggested that we break up the PGP\nprogram into four parts.\n\n  a) Incryption engine\n  b) Key management engine.  \n  c) GUI interface  (DOS, MacOS, UNIX, Windows,  etc) \n  d) Random number generator (machine dependent,  possibly hardware)\n\n  Parts (a) and (b) are the \"portable\" parts,  and (c) and (d) are the\nmachine dependent parts.   Because the Mac is not multi-tasking,  we can\nget around that problem by implementing a random number generator as a\ndriver.   Mac drivers provide for \"periodic\" code to be called as often\nas possible,   and there are plenty of places where this driver can \"look\nfor\" environmental changes to generate random numbers using the hashing\nstuff that Phil implemented.    Naturally,  the IBM-PC and UNIX versions\nof software random number generation would be different.   But as far as\nthe Incryption and Key generators are concerned,  all they need to do,  is\nto look into the random \"seed\" buffer.    Implementing the random number\ngeneration as a driver also affords the possibility of having total \nindependence of a hardware device,   and if one is desired,  no changes\nto the code will be necessary to have one.   We just drop an appropriate\nINIT into the system folder which will contain the appropriate driver.\nThis is the Mac way of doing things.\n\n   One other problem I am having in participating in this group is the\nextra phone expenses I will have.    I cannot get on Netcom's local lines\nfrom here anymore because they are always busy,  and there is a lot of\nother unconsiderate people that hog up all the local lines for many hours\nat a time,   so mail responses to and from me,  may take days.    For\ninstance,  I cannot participate in any IRC chats unless I get local access,\nas I am unemployed and cannot afford to call out of my area.

Eve the eavesdropper, Paul the \nprover, and Vic the verifier are other common stand-in names.\n\n***\tANDOS -- all or nothing disclosure of secrets.\n\n***\tanonymous credential -- a credential which asserts \nsome right or privilege or fact without revealing the identity \nof the holder.  This is unlike CA driver's licenses.\n\n***\tasymmetric cipher -- same as public key \ncryptosystem.\n\n***\tauthentication -- the process of verifying an identity \nor credential, to ensure you are who you said you were.\n\n***\tbiometric security -- a type of authentication using \nfingerprints, retinal scans, palm prints, or other \nphysical/biological signatures of an individual.\n\n***\tbit commitment -- e.g., tossing a coin and then \ncommitting to the value without being able to change the \noutcome. The blob is a cryptographic primitive for this.\n\n***\tblinding, blinded signatures -- A signature that the \nsigner does not remember having made.  A blind signature is \nalways a cooperative protocol and the receiver of the \nsignature provides the signer with the blinding information. \n\n***\tblob -- the crypto equivalent of a locked box. A \ncryptographic primitive for bit commitment, with the \nproperties that a blobs can represent a 0 or a 1, that others \ncannot tell be looking whether itUs a 0 or a 1, that the creator \nof the blob can \"open\" the blob to reveal the contents, and that \nno blob can be both a 1 and a 0. An example of this is a flipped \ncoin covered by a hand.\n\n***\tchannel -- the path over which messages are \ntransmitted. Channels may be secure or insecure, and may \nhave eavesdroppers (or enemies, or disrupters, etc.) who alter \nmessages, insert and delete messages, etc. Cryptography is \nthe means by which communications over insecure channels \nare protected.\n\n***\tchosen plaintext attack -- an attack where the \ncryptanalyst gets to choose the plaintext to be enciphered, \ne.g., when possession of an enciphering machine or algorithm \nis in the possession of the cryptanalyst.\n\n***\tcipher -- a secret form of writing, using substitution or \ntransposition of characters or symbols.\n\n***\tciphertext -- the plaintext after it has been encrypted.\n\n***\tcode -- a restricted cryptosystem where words or \nletters of a message are replaced by other words chosen from \na codebook. Not part of modern cryptology, but still useful.\n\n***\tcoin flipping -- an important crypto primitive, or \nprotocol, in which the equivalent of flipping a fair coin is \npossible. Implemented with blobs.\n\n***\tcollusion -- wherein several participants cooperate to \ndeduce the identity of a sender or receiver, or to break a \ncipher. Most cryptosystems are sensitive to some forms of \ncollusion. Much of the work on implementing DC Nets, for \nexample, involves ensuring that colluders cannot isolate \nmessage senders and thereby trace origins and destinations \nof mail.\n\n***\tcomputationally secure -- where a cipher cannot be \nbroken with available computer resources, but in theory can \nbe broken with enough computer resources. Contrast with \nunconditionally  secure.\n\n***\tcountermeasure -- something you do to thwart an \nattacker.\n\n***\tcredential -- facts or assertions about some entity. For \nexample, credit ratings, passports, reputations, tax status, \ninsurance records, etc.  Under the current system, these \ncredentials are increasingly being cross-linked. Blind \nsignatures may be used to create anonymous credentials.\n\n***\tcredential clearinghouse  -- banks, credit agencies, \ninsurance companies, police departments, etc., that correlate \nrecords and decide the status of records. \n\n***\tcryptanalysis -- methods for attacking and breaking \nciphers and related cryptographic systems. Ciphers may be \nbroken, traffic may be analyzed, and passwords may be \ncracked. Computers are of course essential.\n\n***\tcrypto anarchy -- the economic and political system \nafter the deployment of encryption, untraceable e-mail, \ndigital pseudonyms, cryptographic voting, and digital cash. A \npun on \"crypto,\" meaning \"hidden,\" and as when Gore Vidal \ncalled William F. Buckley a \"crypto fascist.\"\n\n***\tcryptography -- another name for cryptology.\n\n***\tcryptology -- the science and study of writing, sending, \nreceiving, and deciphering secret messages. Includes \nauthentication, digital signatures, the hiding of messages \n(steganography), cryptanalysis, and several other fields.\n\n***\tcyberspace  -- the electronic domain, the Nets, and \ncomputer-generated spaces. Some say it is the \"consensual \nreality\" described in \"Neuromancer.\" Others say it is the phone \nsystem. Others have work to do.\n\n***\tDC protocol, or DC-Net -- the dining cryptographers \nprotocol. DC-Nets use multiple participants communicating \nwith the DC protocol.\n\n***\tDES -- the Data Encryption Standard, proposed in \n1977 by the National Bureau of Standards (now NIST), with \nassistance from the National Security Agency. Based on the \n\"Lucifer\" cipher developed by Horst Feistel at IBM, DES is a \nsecret key cryptosystem that cycles 64-bit blocks of data \nthrough multiple permutations with a 56-bit key controlling \nthe routing. \"Diffusion\" and \"confusion\" are combined to form \na cipher that has not yet been cryptanalyzed (see \"DES, \nSecurity of\"). DES is in use for interbank transfers, as a \ncipher inside of several RSA-based systems, and is available \nfor PCs.\n\n***\tDES, Security of  -- many have speculated that the NSA \nplaced a trapdoor (or back door) in DES to allow it to read \nDES-encrypted messages. This has not been proved. It is \nknown that the original Lucifer algorithm used a 128-bit key \nand that this key length was shortened to 64 bits (56 bits \nplus 8 parity bits), thus making exhaustive search much \neasier (so far as is known, brute-force search has not been \ndone, though it should be feasible today). Shamir and Bihan \nhave used a technique called \"differential cryptanalysis\" to \nreduce the exhaustive search needed for chosen plaintext \nattacks (but with no import for ordinary DES).\n\n***\tdifferential cryptanalysis -- the Shamir-Biham \ntechnique for cryptanalyzing DES. With a chosen plaintext \nattack, they've reduced the number of DES keys that must be \ntried from about 2^56 to about 2^47 or less. Note, however, \nthat rarely can an attacker mount a chosen plaintext attack \non DES systems.\n\n***\tdigital cash, digital money -- Protocols for \ntransferring value, monetary or otherwise, electronically.  \nDigital cash usually refers to systems that are anonymous. \nDigital money systems can be used to implement any quantity \nthat is conserved, such as points, mass, dollars, etc.  There \nare many variations of  digital money systems, ranging from \nVISA numbers to blinded signed digital coins.  A topic too \nlarge for a single glossary entry.\n\n***\tdigital pseudonym -- basically, a \"crypto identity.\" A \nway for individuals to set up accounts with various \norganizations without revealing more information than they \nwish. Users may have several digital pseudonyms, some used \nonly once, some used over the course of many years. Ideally, \nthe pseudonyms can be linked only at the will of the holder. In \nthe simplest form, a public key can serve as a digital \npseudonym and need not be linked to a physical identity.\n\n***\tdigital signature --  Analogous to a written signature \non a document. A modification to a message that only the \nsigner can make but that everyone can recognize.  Can  be used \nlegally to contract at a distance.\n\n***\tdigital timestamping -- one function of a digital \nnotary public, in which some message (a song, screenplay, lab \nnotebook, contract, etc.) is stamped with a time that cannot \n(easily) be forged. \n\n***\tdining cryptographers protocol (aka DC protocol, \nDC nets) -- the untraceable message sending system \ninvented by David Chaum. Named after the \"dining \nphilosophers\" problem in computer science, participants form \ncircuits and pass messages in such a way that the origin \ncannot be deduced, barring collusion. At the simplest level, \ntwo participants share a key between them. One of them \nsends some actual message by bitwise exclusive-ORing the \nmessage with the key, while the other one just sends the key \nitself. The actual message from this pair of participants is \nobtained by XORing the two outputs. However, since nobody \nbut the pair knows the original key, the actual message \ncannot be traced to either one of the participants.\n\n***\tdiscrete logarithm problem -- given integers a, n, \nand x, find some integer m such that a^m mod n = x, if m \nexists. Modular exponentiation, the a^m mod n part, is \nstraightforward (and special purpose chips are available), but \nthe inverse problem is believed to be very hard, in general.  \nThus it is conjectured that modular exponentiation is a one-\nway function.\n\n***\tDSS, Digital Signature Standard -- the latest NIST \n(National Institute of Standards and Technology, successor to \nNBS) standard for digital signatures. Based on the El Gamal \ncipher, some consider it weak and poor substitute for RSA-\nbased signature schemes.\n\n***\teavesdropping, or passive wiretapping -- \nintercepting messages without detection. Radio waves may be \nintercepted, phone lines may be tapped, and computers may \nhave RF emissions detected. Even fiber optic lines can be \ntapped.\n\n***\tfactoring -- Some large numbers are difficult to factor. \nIt is conjectured that there are no feasible--i.e.\"easy,\" less \nthan exponential in size of number-- factoring methods. It is \nalso an open problem whether RSA may be broken more easily \nthan by factoring the modulus (e.g., the public key might \nreveal information which simplifies the problem). \nInterestingly, though factoring is believed to be \"hard\", it is \nnot known to be in the class of NP-hard problems. Professor \nJanek invented a factoring device, but he is believed to be \nfictional.\n\n***\tinformation-theoretic security -- \"unbreakable\" \nsecurity, in which no amount of cryptanalysis can break a \ncipher or system. One time pads are an example (providing the \npads are not lost nor stolen nor used more than once, of \ncourse). Same as unconditionally secure.\n\n***\tkey -- a piece of information needed to encipher or \ndecipher a message. Keys may be stolen, bought, lost, etc., \njust as with physical keys.\n\n***\tkey exchange, or key distribution -- the process of \nsharing a key with some other party, in the case of symmetric \nciphers, or of distributing a  public key in an asymmetric \ncipher. A major issue is that the keys be exchanged reliably \nand without compromise. Diffie and Hellman devised one such \nscheme, based on the discrete logarithm problem. \n\n***\tknown-plaintext attack -- a cryptanalysis of a cipher \nwhere plaintext-ciphertext pairs are known. This attack \nsearches for an unknown key. Contrast with the chosen \nplaintext attack, where the cryptanalyst can also choose the \nplaintext to be enciphered.\n\n***\tmail, untraceable  -- a system for sending and \nreceiving mail without traceability or observability. \nReceiving mail anonymously can be done with broadcast of the \nmail in encrypted form.  Only the intended recipient (whose \nidentity, or true name, may be unknown to the sender) may \nable to decipher the message. Sending mail anonymously \napparently requires mixes or use of the dining cryptographers \n(DC) protocol.\n\n***\tminimum disclosure proofs  -- another name for zero \nknowledge proofs, favored by Chaum.\n\n***\tmixes -- David Chaum's term for a box which performs \nthe function of mixing, or decorrelating, incoming and \noutgoing electronic mail messages. The box also strips off \nthe outer envelope (i.e., decrypts with its private key) and \nremails the message to the address on the inner envelope. \nTamper-resistant modules may be used to prevent cheating \nand forced disclosure of the mapping between incoming and \noutgoing mail. A sequence of many remailings effectively \nmakes tracing sending and receiving impossible. Contrast this \nwith the software version, the DC protocol.\n\n***\tmodular exponentiation  -- raising an integer to the \npower of another integer, modulo some integer. For integers \na, n, and m, a^m mod n. For example, 5^3 mod 100 = 25. Modular \nexponentiation can be done fairly quickly with a sequence of \nbit shifts and adds, and special purpose chips have been \ndesigned. See also discrete logarithm.\n\n***\tNational Security Agency (NSA)  -- the largest \nintelligence agency, responsible for making and breaking \nciphers, for intercepting communications, and for ensuring \nthe security of U.S. computers. Headquartered in Fort Meade, \nMaryland, with many listening posts around the world.  The \nNSA funds cryptographic research and advises other agencies \nabout cryptographic matters. The NSA once obviously had the \nworld's leading cryptologists, but this may no longer be the \ncase.\n\n***\tnegative credential -- a credential that you possess \nthat you don't want any one else to know, for example, a \nbankruptcy filing.  A formal version of a negative reputation.\n\n***\tNP-complete -- a large class of difficult problems.  \n\"NP\" stands for nondeterministic polynomial time, a class of \nproblems thought in general not to have feasible algorithms \nfor their solution.  A problem is \"complete\"  if  any other NP \nproblem may be reduced to that problem.   Many important \ncombinatorial and algebraic problems are NP-complete: the \ntraveling salesman problem, the Hamiltonian cycle problem, \nthe word problem, and on and on.\n\n***\toblivious transfer -- a cryptographic primitive that \ninvolves the probabilistic transmission of bits. The sender \ndoes not know if the bits were received.\n\n***\tone-time pad -- a string of randomly-selected bits or \nsymbols which is combined with a plaintext message to \nproduce the ciphertext. This combination may be shifting \nletters some amount, bitwise exclusive-ORed, etc.). The \nrecipient, who also has a copy of the one time pad, can easily \nrecover the plaintext. Provided the pad is only used once and \nthen destroyed, and is not available to an eavesdropper, the \nsystem is perfectly secure, i.e., it is information-\ntheoretically secure. Key distribution (the pad)  is obviously a \npractical concern, but consider CD-ROM's.\n\n***\tone-way function -- a function which is easy to \ncompute in one direction but hard to find any inverse for, e.g. \nmodular exponentiation, where the inverse problem is known \nas the discrete logarithm problem. Compare the special case \nof trap door one-way functions.  An example of  a one-way \noperation is multiplication: it is  easy to multiply two \nprime numbers of 100 digits to produce a 200-digit number, \nbut  hard to factor that 200-digit number. \n\n***\tP ?=? NP  -- Certainly the most  important unsolved \nproblem in complexity theory. If P = NP, then cryptography as \nwe know it today does not exist.  If P = NP,  all NP problems \nare \"easy.\" \n\n***\tpadding -- sending extra messages to confuse \neavesdroppers and to defeat traffic analysis.   Also adding \nrandom bits to a message to be enciphered.\n\n***\tplaintext -- also called cleartext, the text that is to be \nenciphered.\n\n***\tPretty Good Privacy (PGP)  -- Phillip ZimmermanUs \nimplementation of RSA, recently upgraded to version 2.0, \nwith more robust components and several new features. RSA \nData Security has threatened PZ so he no longer works on it.  \nVersion 2.0 was written by a consortium of non-U.S. hackers.\n\n***\tprime numbers -- integers with no factors other than \nthemselves and 1. The number of primes is unbounded.  About \n1% of the 100 decimal digit numbers are prime.  Since there \nare about 10^70 particles in the universe, there are about \n10^23  100 digit primes for each and every particle in the \nuniverse!\n\n***\tprobabilistic encryption  -- a scheme by Goldwasser, \nMicali, and Blum that allows multiple ciphertexts for the \nsame plaintext, i.e., any given plaintext may have many \nciphertexts if the ciphering is repeated. This protects against \ncertain types of known ciphertext attacks on RSA.\n\n***\tproofs of identity -- proving who you are, either your \ntrue name, or your digital identity. Generally, possession of \nthe right key is sufficient proof (guard your key!). Some work \nhas been done on \"is-a-person\" credentialling agencies, using \nthe so-called Fiat-Shamir protocol...think of this as a way to \nissue unforgeable digital passports. Physical proof of identity \nmay be done with biometric security methods. Zero knowledge \nproofs of identity reveal nothing beyond the fact that the \nidentity is as claimed. This has obvious uses for computer \naccess, passwords, etc.\n\n***\tprotocol -- a formal procedure for solving some \nproblem. Modern cryptology is mostly about the study of \nprotocols for many problems, such as coin-flipping, bit \ncommitment (blobs), zero knowledge proofs, dining \ncryptographers, and so on.\n\n***\tpublic key -- the key distributed publicly to potential \nmessage-senders. It may be published in a phonebook-like \ndirectory or otherwise sent. A major concern is the validity \nof this public key to guard against spoofing or impersonation.\n\n***\tpublic key cryptosystem -- the modern breakthrough \nin cryptology, designed by Diffie and Hellman, with \ncontributions from several others. Uses trap door one-way \nfunctions so that encryption may be done by anyone with \naccess to the \"public key\" but decryption may be done only by \nthe holder of the \"private key.\" Encompasses public key \nencryption, digital signatures, digital cash, and many other \nprotocols and applications.\n\n***\tpublic key encryption -- the use of modern \ncryptologic methods to provided message security and \nauthentication. The RSA algorithm is the most widely used \nform of public key encryption, although other systems exist. \nA public key may be freely published, e.g., in phonebook-like \ndirectories, while the corresponding private key is closely \nguarded.\n\n***\tpublic key patents  -- M.I.T. and Stanford, due to the \nwork of Rivest, Shamir, Adleman, Diffie, Hellman, and Merkle, \nformed Public Key Partners to license the various public key, \ndigital signature, and RSA patents. These patents, granted in \nthe early 1980s, expire in the between 1998 and 2002. PKP \nhas licensed RSA Data Security Inc., of Redwood City, CA, \nwhich handles the sales, etc.\n\n***\tquantum cryptography -- a system based on quantum-\nmechanical principles. Eavesdroppers alter the quantum state \nof the system and so are detected. Developed by Brassard and \nBennett, only small laboratory demonstrations have been \nmade.\n\n***\treputations -- the trail of positive and negative \nassociations and judgments that some entity accrues. Credit \nratings, academic credentials, and trustworthiness are all \nexamples. A digital pseudonym will accrue these reputation \ncredentials based on actions, opinions of others, etc. In \ncrypto anarchy, reputations and agoric systems will be of \nparamount importance. There are many fascinating issues of \nhow reputation-based systems work, how credentials can be \nbought and sold, and so forth.\n\n***\tRSA -- the main public key encryption algorithm, \ndeveloped by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Kenneth Adleman. It \nexploits the difficulty of factoring large numbers to create a \nprivate key and public key. First invented in 1978, it remains \nthe core of modern public key systems. It is usually much \nslower than DES, but special-purpose modular exponentiation \nchips will likely speed it up. A popular scheme for speed is to \nuse RSA to transmit session keys and then a high-speed \ncipher like DES for the actual message text.\n***\tDescription -- Let p and q be large primes, typically with more than \n100 digits. Let n = pq and find some e such that e is relatively prime to (p \n- 1)(q - 1). The set of numbers p, q, and e is the private key for RSA. The \nset of numbers n and e forms the public key (recall that knowing n is not \nsufficient to easily find p and q...the factoring problem).  A message M is \nencrypted by computing M^e mod n. The owner of the private key can \ndecrypt the encrypted message by exploiting number theory results, as \nfollows. An integer d is computed such that ed =1 (mod (p - 1)(q - 1)). \nEuler proved a theorem that M^(ed) = M mod n and so M^(ed) mod n = M. \nThis means that in some sense the integers e and d are \"inverses\" of each \nother. [If this is unclear, please see one of the many texts and articles on \npublic key encryption.]\n\n***\tsecret key cryptosystem -- A system which uses the \nsame key to encrypt and decrypt traffic at each end of a \ncommunication link.  Also called a symmetric or one-key \nsystem.  Contrast with public key cryptosystem.\n\n***\tsmart cards -- a computer chip embedded in credit \ncard.  They can hold cash, credentials, cryptographic keys, \netc. Usually these are built with some degree of tamper-\nresistance. Smart cards may perform part of a crypto \ntransaction, or all of it. Performing part of it may mean \nchecking the computations of a more powerful computer, e.g., \none in an ATM.\n\n***\tspoofing, or masquerading -- posing as another user. \nUsed for stealing passwords, modifying files, and  stealing \ncash. Digital signatures and other authentication methods are \nuseful to prevent this. Public keys must be validated and \nprotected to ensure that others don't substitute their own \npublic keys which users may then unwittingly use.\n\n***\tsteganography -- a part of cryptology dealing with \nhiding messages and obscuring who is sending and receiving \nmessages. Message traffic is often padded to reduce the \nsignals that would otherwise come from a sudden beginning \nof messages.\n\n***\tsymmetric cipher -- same as private key \ncryptosystem.\n \n***\ttamper-responding modules, tamper-resistant \nmodules (TRMs) -- sealed boxes or modules which are hard \nto open, requiring extensive probing and usually leaving ample \nevidence that the tampering has occurred. Various protective \ntechniques are used, such as special metal or oxide layers on \nchips, armored coatings, embedded optical fibers, and other \nmeasures to thwart analysis. Popularly called \"tamper-proof \nboxes.\" Uses include: smart cards, nuclear weapon initiators, \ncryptographic key holders, ATMs, etc.\n\n***\ttampering, or active wiretapping -- interfering with \nmessages and possibly modifying them. This may compromise \ndata security, help to break ciphers, etc.  See also spoofing.\n\n***\ttoken -- some representation, such as ID cards, subway \ntokens, money, etc., that indicates possession of some \nproperty or value. \n\n***\ttraffic analysis -- determining who is sending or \nreceiving messages by analyzing packets, frequency of \npackets, etc. A part of steganography. Usually handled with \ntraffic padding.\n\n***\ttransmission rules -- the protocols for determining \nwho can send messages in a DC protocol, and when. These \nrules are needed to prevent collision and deliberate jamming \nof the channels.\n\n***\ttrap messages -- dummy messages in DC Nets which \nare used to catch jammers and disrupters. The messages \ncontain no private information and are published in a blob \nbeforehand so that the trap message can later be opened to \nreveal the disrupter. (There are many strategies to explore \nhere.)\n\n***\ttrap-door -- In cryptography, a piece of secret \ninformation that allows the holder of a private key to invert a \nnormally hard to invert function.\n\n***\ttrap-door one way functions -- functions which are \neasy to compute in both the forward and reverse direction but \nfor which the disclosure of an algorithm to compute the \nfunction in the forward direction does not provide \ninformation on how to compute the function in the reverse \ndirection. More simply put, trap-door one way functions are \none way for all but the holder of the secret information. The \nRSA algorithm is the best-known example of such a function.\n\n***\tunconditional security -- same as information-\ntheoretic security, that is, unbreakable except by loss or \ntheft of the key.\n\n***\tunconditionally  secure -- where no amount of \nintercepted ciphertext is enough to allow the cipher to be \nbroken, as with the use of a one-time pad cipher. Contrast \nwith computationally secure.\n\n***\tvoting, cryptographic -- Various schemes have been \ndevised for anonymous, untraceable voting. Voting schemes \nshould have several properties: privacy of the vote, security \nof the vote (no multiple votes), robustness against disruption \nby jammers or disrupters, verifiability (voter has confidence \nin the results), and efficiency.\n\n***\tzero knowledge proofs -- proofs in which no \nknowledge of the actual proof is conveyed. Peggy the Prover \ndemonstrates to Sid the Skeptic that she is indeed in \npossession of some piece of knowledge without actually \nrevealing any of that knowledge.

The 'print \"\\n\" ;' line was moved inside the new\nif statement.  The if statement reads a line of the body and stops the\nscript if there is no body.  The line read is tested to see if it\ncontains the two characters \"##\" alone on the line.  \"##\" is the ANSI\nC token pasting operator.  If there is no pasting, a blank line is\nprinted to mark the end of the header and the first line of the body\nis printed.  If there is pasting, then the conditional does nothing,\nwhich has the effect that the body is appended directly onto the end\nof the header, allowing you to add more header lines after the header\nis rewritten.\n\n\nHere is a sample message that I sent myself after the new script was\ninstalled:\n\n--------- cut here ---------\nTo: hughes\nSubject: multiple hops\nRequest-Remailing-To: hughes\n\n##\nX-Hop: 1\nRequest-Remailing-To: hughes\n\n##\nX-Hop: 2\nRequest-Remailing-To: hughes\n\n##\nX-Hop: 3\n\nThis is a test message of multiple hops.\n\nEric\n--------- cut here ---------\n\n\nI received four pieces of mail after sending this to myself.  The\nfirst was the actual letter, which is still delivering normally and\nnot being filtered.  The next two were the first and second\nremailings; they had X-Hop: 1 and 2.  The last message was the final\none, had X-Hop: 3 in its header and was delivered normally.\n\nAt each stage, the header got rewritten and a new\nRequest-Remailing-To: line inserted.  When that mail got delivered, it\nwas again rewritten, with a new remailing request.  This process is\nextensible up to the 50K or so practical limitatation on mail size.\n\nNote that this system is not at all secure by itself.  But if each\nmessage body were encrypted first, and the message first decrypted\nbefore the header re-write took place, the routing instructions as a\nwhole would be hidden from prying eyes.\n\nThat's the next project.\n\nEric", "body_length": 2857, "has_pgp": false, "flags": [], "parent_id": null, "children_ids": [], "is_thread_root": true, "orphan_status": "true_root", "normalized_subject": "the hopping remailer is done", "thread_id": "thread_43338251b4e7a8dc"}, {"id": "869644da0988619e", "year": 1992, "source_file": "cyp-1992.txt", "line_number": 10409, "from_raw": "Eric Hollander <hh@soda.berkeley.edu>", "from_name": "Eric Hollander", "from_email": "hh@soda.berkeley.edu", "date_raw": "Tue, 20 Oct 92 16:53:46 PDT", "date_parsed": "1992-10-20T16:53:46-07:00", "subject": "another service", "message_id": "9210202353.AA04723@soda.berkeley.edu", "in_reply_to": null, "references": [], "to": "cypherpunks@toad.com", "cc": "", "content_type": "text/plain", "body": "I have thought of another service, like the depository, which might be\nuseful to the user community:  a time stamping notary service.

May)\nSubject: A Silver Bullet to Limit Crypto?\nDate: Wed, 11 Nov 1992 18:36:44 GMT\n\n\nKey Registration as a \"Silver Bullet\" to Limit Crypto Use\n\n\nTwo weeks ago, and more than 500 related messages ago, I posted the\n\"Trial Balloon to Ban Encryption?\" message, alerting sci.crypt and\nother newsgroups to the Dorothy Denning \"trial balloon.\" Prof. Denning\nhas continued the balloon metaphor, calling her first proposal a \"lead\nballoon\" and her improved, law-enforcement-friendly version a \"copper\nballoon.\" Others have called it a \"uranium balloon,\" i.e., it's worse\nthan the lead balloon.\n\nIn reading the hundreds of comments about ways to bypass the Denning\nproposal, about the many clever schemes to avoid detection, I came to\nsome realizations about the likely reason for key registration. Also,\nat the recent Hackers Conference in Lake Tahoe, lots of interesting\npoints came up (crypto, PGP, anonymous remailers, digital cash,\nprivacy, and the \"Crypto Crackdown,\" to borrow Bruce Sterling's title\nof \"The Hacker Crackdown,\" were hot topics). Mike Godwin of the EFF,\nwho may be reading this in comp.org.eff.talk, spoke on such\npolicies...he told us this kind of crackdown on crypto tools is a\npriority of several government agencies and that the issue will not go\naway with the new administration.\n\nBut why scheme to register keys, by whatever means, if the system is\nso easily thwarted and bypassed? Neither Prof. Denning nor her\ncolleagues, both in and out of the NSA and FBI, are dummies.\n\nThe \"silver balloon,\" or silver bullet, is this:\n\n* a formal key registration system will directly affect and limit use\nof the _most important_ part of public key systems: the ability to use\npublic key directories (like phone books) rather than set up all\ncommunications on a one-to-one basis (as private key systems require,\nfor key exchange, and as many of the key registration bypasses\nimplicitly or explicitly require).\n\n* enforcement, at least for publicly announced P-K keys, can be by\ninsisting that a special message (\"This is J. Random User.\") be signed\nwith one's registered/deposited key and then verified with the public\nkey to ensure the same private key-public key pair is used. (Yes,\nthere are still bypasses and clevernesses to spoof these systems, but\nmost \"publicly visible\" use of P-K methods, the main raison d'etre for\npublic keys, will be affected and effectively controlled.) Keys can\nand will be registered under this proposal, but many people will\nsimply not bother with the hassle and just won't use P-K methods (thus\nmaking the monitoring job easier).\n\n* bypassing the key registration laws by \"going underground\" is always\npossible, but for this purpose one can already use one-time pads, pack\nmessage bits into the least significant bits of digital recordings and\nimages, and generally do all sorts of other devious things. The key\npoint is that the wide use of public key methods is reduced, which may\nbe the real motivation.\n\n* reducing the wide use of crypto technology by the masses allows the\nmonitoring agencies a slightly easier job in monitoring those who\n_are_ using crypto. One can imagine exactly the same arguments for\nrestricting or registering voice scramblers for phone use: by\nrequiring registration, fees, etc., many users will simply not bother\nto use scrambling (and there may be related to spread the idea that\nanyone using scrambling--or crypto in general--is somehow suspect,\nmust have something to hide, etc.\n\n* the key registration ideas discussed so far severely limit use of\ncrypto protocols that _dynamically_ generate lots of public keys.\nCryptographic voting, most forms of digital cash, anonymous remailers,\nand several other exciting uses all tend to generate a lot of keys \"on\nthe fly.\" Are all of these to be registered? How? For how much money\nper registration? And how long will it take? Weeks?\n\nInstead of concentrating on how these kinds of uses, mentioned by many\npeople, effectively make the Denning/Rivest/Micali proposals\nunworkable, we should look instead at how these proposals may _in\nfact_ be aimed at limiting the explosive use of crypto for these new\napplications. A government afraid of digital cash, of anonymous\nremailing networks, of information markets in technologies, and of\nlots of other interesting uses, may see key registration as a way to\ncontain this explosion.\n\nEven if the private keys kept at the \"trusted key authority\" were\n_never_ looked at by court order or otherwise, the key registration\nact itself would place severe limits on the use of modern\ncryptographic protocols for novel uses and for wide use by the public.\n\nIn this sense, the key registration idea may be a silver bullet, or\nballoon, to head off these uses. A chilling effect (the \"liquid\nnitrogen balloon\"?).\n\nAny thoughts on this view?\n\n\n\n-- \n..........................................................................\nTimothy C.

I suspect, in\nany case, that the added security isn't all that great since I suspect\nit's very hard to find another valid key-pair where the public key\nmatches the last 24 bits plus some fragment of another 20 bits or so\nfrom the middle of the key.\n \nPhone, as opposed to mailed paper verifications has the following\nproblems:\n \nPhil says you have to recognize the voice, which implies you've met\nhim in close quarters, which implies you could have exchanged keys\nphysically anyway.  If the only place you've heard the voice is\nover the phone, that's not a very good criterion.\n \nPhone verification is good, IMHO, *only* if the person being verified\nis *called at a listed number*. You can't verify a person who calls you,\n(unless you know the voice).  You can't verify a person you call at\nan unlisted number which you got over the net!!\n \nEconomics: Net participants are scattered over the country and even the\nworld. Paper verification costs about $2-$3 allowing for my fee, copying\ncosts and two-way international postage. Adding notarization adds about\n$5.00.  Phone verification is economical locally (maybe cheaper than\nmail), but more expensive when long-distance rates apply, especially\ninternational rates.\n \nMeeting at parties or face-to-face is most expensive of all, unless\nthe meeting happens fortuitously. Overseas plane fare to exchange keys\nis beyond the means of most of us.\n \nPhil says:\n \n    I would much rather trust a simple verification procedure based on\n    redundancy and close personal relationships than a single,\n    complex, impersonal process involving people I don't know.  This\n    is not to impugn your integrity, of course -- I'm simply speaking\n    on principle.\n \nNo offense taken!  I, on the other hand, would rather have in my hand\na signed statement of identity with photocopied ID that I can keep\nand file away.  I also don't want to go broke making international\nphone calls.\n \nAs it happens, I, so far, have not been able to sign a single key!!\n \nI called Phil Zimmerman at a listed number, I read him my key and\nhe signed it, but he was called away from the phone before he could\nverify his key to me. So I can't sign his!\n \nI've met a few people at parties I've given my paper key (fragments)\nto. So far none of them have signed my key, but none of them had\npaper key fragments to trade, so I can't sign theirs.\n \nGeorge Gleason commented about supplying home addresses.  Your\ncomments are well taken. Phil Zimmerman also commented to me in E-mail\nthat some people don't want the serial numbers on their photo ID\ncopied.  Everyone please feel free not to supply a home address and\nto obscure any home address or serial number on the photocopied\nphoto ID. I'll still sign your key, although I'll note what you did\nin my signed key directory, which I'll send to customers & publish\nhere.  If you don't want *me* to know your home address, you can\nuse a P.O. box for me to return my (or other customers') ID\ncertificate(s) to you. On the other hand, as the service provider,\nMY home address and phone are public info.\n \nI also acknowledge George's criticism re the \"I'm not a cop\"\nstatement. I'm going to leave it in my statement, because it's\ntrue, but in general you should be aware that any legal protection is\nquestionable at best.  The lack of protection has been verified by\na source on Extropians and by an attorney on the RIME network.\n \nIn the meantime, I guess we can discuss illegal subjects not with\n\"I've done ...\" but with \"I've heard that ...\" or \"I used to know\nsomebody who ...\".

(For those to\nwhom this proposal is new, strange, or disturbing, please see the\ndebate raging mainly in the newsgroup \"sci.crypt\".)\n\nOnce the principle is established that private communications,\nletters, faxes, modem transmissions, etc. must be in a form\nreadable--under court order, as Dorothy Denning's proposal goes--by\nthe government, and that \"public key encryption\" keys must be\nregistered with the authorities, then we can expect the following:\n\n* _Classes_ of encryption keys, with some especially strong (in a\ncryptograhic sense) keys being declared \"assault keys,\" just as\ncertain classes of semiautomatic rifles have been branded \"assault\nweapons\" and subjected to media villification and even confiscation by\nthe authorities. In analogy with firearms, there may be \"Class 1\"\ndealers in \"dangerous\" keys.\n\n* There may even be _bans_ on the registration (and hence use) of\ncertain classes of algorithms and key lengths. For example,\n\"civilians\" may be allowed to use DES, but not RSA. Or the key length\nmay be restricted in various ways.\n\n* Strict controls over the types of algorithms allowed. After all,\nwhat use will a key be if the government can't run the algorithm?\nThis, by the way, will be another way to control the spread of\nencryption technology: if only licensed, inspected, and approved\nalgorithms are acceptable to the key registration authorities,\ninnovation and experimentation will suffer. This may make RSA Data\nSecurity, Inc., very happy, as it may get the \"franchise,\" while users\nof bootleg/contraband/experimental algorithms like PGP 2.0 (\"Pretty\nGood Privacy\") face severe sanctions.\n\n* Spot checks will have to be done to ensure compliance. This may be\ndone in various ways, such as by randomly checking bitstreams and\ndemanding the sender open the message. (Note: Many have posted that\nthis would not be possible. Untrue. The Rehnquist Supreme Court ruled\na couple of years ago that the police could enter a bus and ask the\npassengers to \"voluntarily\" accept a search of their baggage. Failure\nto volunteer, so reasoned the court, constituted probable cause for a\nsearch! \"Catch-22\" meets \"1984.\")\n\n* The penalties for noncompliance, or for hiding encrypted messages\ninside other messages, will likely be severe, else widespread civil\ndisobedience and claims of \"ignorance\" will result. (Personally, I\n_expect_ widespread noncompliance. Many people will even flaunt their\nnoncompliance, encrypting truly innocuous messages that few courts,\nthey will hope, will convict them for. Here in California, the\nnoncompliance rate for registration of those evil \"assault weapons\" is\nestimated to be as high as 80%.)\n\n(My best guess is that the \"RICO\" (Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt\nOrganizations Act) and civil forfeiture approaches will be used to\nsimply seize the equipment of anyonone caught sending messages without\nthe suitable seals of approval. Such seizures, used with suspected gun\nsellers, suspected X-rated video sellers, suspected drug dealers. and\nso on, have had a profoundly chilling effect.)\n\n* A registration system, even if well-intentioned and secured against\ncasual government snooping (and some of the multi-party escrow systems\nmay help do this), will still _greatly complicate_ the use of encryption\nand will forestall certain very exciting applications of cryptology.\nMany of the new proposals, for things like anonymous credentials to\nprotect privacy, for digital cash, and for cryptographic voting\nsystems, essentially require the _dynamic_ generation of keys! That\nis, keys are generated frequently as part of the protocols...there is\nnot single static \"public key\" that one generates once and then takes\ndown to the crypto equivalent of the DMV for registration.\n\n* As with guns, true criminals will of course ignore these laws.\nComputer networks are already being used for messages that evade\nwiretaps (as one example, a Mafia guy in New Jersey, on the run, used a\nwell-known computer service to communicate untraceably with his wife),\nthat are used for laundering information and money, and so on. Taking\nencryption away from citizens will do nothing.\n\n\nI urge readers to get involved in this debate.\n\n\n\"If encryption is outlawed, only outlaws--and the NSA--will have encryption.\"\n\n\n\n-- \n..........................................................................\nTimothy C.

Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy must\ncreate it for themselves and not expect governments, corporations, or\nother large, faceless organizations to grant them privacy out of\nbeneficence.  Cypherpunks know that people have been creating their\nown privacy for centuries with whispers, envelopes, closed doors, and\ncouriers.  Cypherpunks do not seek to prevent other people from\nspeaking about their experiences or their opinions.\n\nThe most important means to the defense of privacy is encryption. To\nencrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy.  But to encrypt with\nweak cryptography is to indicate not too much desire for privacy.\nCypherpunks hope that all people desiring privacy will learn how best\nto defend it.\n\nCypherpunks are therefore devoted to cryptography.  Cypherpunks wish\nto learn about it, to teach it, to implement it, and to make more of\nit.  Cypherpunks know that cryptographic protocols make social\nstructures.  Cypherpunks know how to attack a system and how to\ndefend it.  Cypherpunks know just how hard it is to make good\ncryptosystems.\n\nCypherpunks love to practice.  They love to play with public key\ncryptography.  They love to play with anonymous and pseudonymous mail\nforwarding and delivery.  They love to play with DC-nets.  They love\nto play with secure communications of all kinds.\n\nCypherpunks write code.  They know that someone has to write code to\ndefend privacy, and since it's their privacy, their going to write\nit.

The intent is to make security-enhanced features\navailable in something called OCE (Open Collaboration Environment) which is\nto be Apple's entry in the E-mail / user directory / etc.  marketplace. \nOCE is likely to be an add-on, that is, something not shipped with every\nMac, but available at extra cost.  Since I'm under NDA for the details of\nOCE, I will simply quote what MacLeak says:\n\n According to MacWeek, Apple is using RSA software with 150-200 digit\nprimes for Digital Signatures. They are using \"RSA's RC4 algorithm [which\nwill] provide\n encryption of the fly for data transmitted across an OCE (open\nCollaboratioon Environment) network. Each message will be scrambled using a\nunique 64-bit key.\n\nBTW, notice that's decimal digits, not bits, in the signature length.\n\nApple is set up as a certifying authority, but I don't know any details of\nthe plans on how to certify keys.  It's a far from simple problem to work\nout something that will work in the current personal computer market\nstructure and isn't subject to spoofing.\n\nRe Apple licensing PGP code:  While Apple could presumably do so without\nviolating any laws, so long as any copyright holders in PGP granted\nappropriate rights, I don't think it's very likely.  OCE is a package to be\ndifferentiated by its user interface, and apparently MacPGP's (though I\nhaven't tried it myself yet) is rather crufty from the Mac point of view. \nAlso, Apple traditionally wants very tight control over its source code,\nand is unlikely to adopt something that arrives in such a (shall we say)\n'informal' fashion from outside.\n\nFinally, as a dose of preventive medicine, I should mention that all of the\nabove is my best interpretation of Apple policy and probable action, with\nwhich I don't necessarily agree personally.  Flameage ignoring this\nstatement will be routed appropriately.\n\nTim Oren", "body_length": 2185, "has_pgp": false, "flags": [], "parent_id": null, "children_ids": ["9211152157.AA22323@servo", "4195@eternity.demon.co.uk"], "is_thread_root": true, "orphan_status": "orphan_reply", "orphan_type": "no_in_reply_to", "normalized_subject": "apple including pks?", "thread_id": "thread_9b9cbe508b91e921"}, {"id": "8fd83352db691e0a", "year": 1992, "source_file": "cyp-1992.txt", "line_number": 6686, "from_raw": "Hal <74076.1041@CompuServe.COM>", "from_name": "Hal", "from_email": "74076.1041@compuserve.com", "date_raw": "Tue, 13 Oct 92 08:55:18 PDT", "date_parsed": "1992-10-13T08:55:18-07:00", "subject": "Re: Mr. Squirrel", "message_id": "921013154244_74076.1041_DHJ92-2@CompuServe.COM", "in_reply_to": null, "references": [], "to": "CYPHERPUNKS <CYPHERPUNKS@TOAD.COM>", "cc": "", "content_type": "text/plain", "body": "||ugh Daniel raises some questions about using public keys to\nverify pseudonyms:\n\n>   Hal is somewhat right, anyone can use 'Secret Squirrel' and anyone\n> can use any public key they want also.\n\nBut, once person A creates public key X, nobody else can sign messages\nusing X.

Used with permission>\n\n\nThe basic remailer illustrates how to hook in automated software\nprocessing into the Unix mail system.  Here are the basic elements.\n\n1. .forward\n2. slocal and .maildelivery\n3. remail.perl\n4. /usr/lib/sendmail\n\n--------------------------------------------\n1. .forward\n\nUnix mail provides a way to have accounts on many different machines\nbut to receive all your mail in one place.  That facility is the\n.forward file, which resides in the home directory.  The file is one\nline long and contains the email address to which the mail will be\nforwarded.\n\nBut the .forward file has another mode of operation.  If the string\nbegins with the pipe character '|', the mail will be piped through the\nprogram listed.  Enclose the string with double quotes if you need\nspaces included.  Here is my .forward file:\n\n\"| /usr/local/lib/mh/slocal -user hughes\"\n\nThus all my mail gets processed by the slocal program, described next.\n\nI don't know where the man page for .forward is.  Perhaps someone\ncould provide a reference.\n\n---------\n\n2. slocal and .maildelivery\n\nThe software system MH contains a bunch of useful tools for handling\nmail, only one of which we need.  For details on MH, do 'man mh'.\n\nMH has a nice little mail hook processor called slocal.  Its docs can\nbe found by 'man mhook'.  slocal can conditionally perform operations\non mail messages and consider them either delivered or not.  It allows\nmultiple operations on individual mail messages.\n\nslocal reads the file .maildelivery when it starts up for\ninstructions. Here is my .maildelivery file:\n\n#\n# field\t\t\tpattern\taction/\tstring \n#\t\t\t\tresult\t(quote included spaces)\n#\nRequest-Remailing-To\t\"\"\tpipe R\t\"perl remail.perl\" \nRequest-Remailing-To\t\"\"\tfile R\tarchive.remailer\n\nThe various pieces of the .maildelivery file are fully documented in\nthe man page.  I'll just explain what mine does.  Each line describes\none operation to be performed on each incoming mail message.  Fields\nare separated by whitespace, so if you need to include spaces, use\nquotes.\n\nThe first field, labelled field, is the mail header field to look for.\nslocal can selectively process on any header line.  If the header line\ndoes not exist, then the mail does not match this line and no\noperation is performed.  If the header line does exist, processing\ncontinues.\n\nThe second field, pattern, is a text string to match with the contents\nof that header line, i.e. with everything after the colon.  In my\ncase, I put the empty string in, which matches everything.  You need\nthe pair of quotes to have a placeholder for the field contents.\n\nThe next field, action, tells what to do with the message.  'pipe'\nsends the message to the standard input of the named program.  'file'\nappends the message to an archive or log file.  A useful pipe command\nfor testing is \"tee foo\", which makes a copy of the message in file\nfoo, but does not append, so that you get an exact copy of what slocal\nis going to pass to your pipe.  This allows testing of the pipe\nprogram without sending yourself mail all the time.\n\nThe next field, result, tells what to do with the message after\nprocessing.  I am currently using R for Regardless to indicate that\nthis action should always be performed no matter what.  The code R\nindicates that the mail should be considered not delivered after\nprocessing; thus slocal writes the mail back into my local spool and I\nsee it as normal.  Later, after I'm sick of looking at all the\nforwarded mail, I'll change this code to A, meaning if the processing\nsucceeds, then the mail is considered delivered.  The archive file\nwill always remain R.\n\nThe last field, string, is the parameter to the action.  It is a file\nname or program.  Use quotes to include spaces.  The name of my mail\nprocessor is \"perl remail.perl\", which is to run the perl script\nremail.perl on the mail.\n\nThe .maildelivery file is also the place to put encryption hooks to\nautomatically decrypt the bodies of messages.  More on that in a\nfuture version.\n\n---------\n\n3. remail.perl\n\nPerl is a wonderful language for doing all sorts of useful work like\nprocessing mail headers.  Do 'man perl' for details, or get the\nO'Reilly book and really learn how to use it.\n\nThe perl script, in summary, strips off the mail headers, saving the\nSubject: line, rewrites a new header, and appends the body of the\nprevious message.  Here is the script:\n\n--------- cut here ---------\nwhile (<>) {\n\tlast if /^$/ ;\n\t$subject = $_ if /^Subject:/ ;\n\tif (/^Request-Remailing-To:/) {\n\t\tchop ;\n\t\ts/^.*:// ;\n\t\t$addressee = $_ ;\n\t}\n}\n\n#open( OUTPUT, \">foo\" ) || die \"Cannot open 'foo'.\" ;\nopen( OUTPUT, \"| /usr/lib/sendmail \" . $addressee ) ;\nselect( OUTPUT ) ;\n\nprint \"To:\" . $addressee . \"\\n\" ;\nprint \"From: nobody\\n\" ;\nprint $subject ;\nprint \"Remailed-By: Eric Hughes <hughes@soda.berkeley.edu>\\n\" ;\nprint \"\\n\" ;\n\nwhile (<>) {\n} continue {\n\tprint ;\n}\n--------- cut here ---------\n\nHere is a summary of the operation.  To really understand this, you'll\nhave to learn perl.\n\nThe while loop processes standard input.  'last' terminates the loop\nas soon as a blank line is seen.  A blank line separates the header\nfrom the body.  The subject line, if seen, sets the subject variable\nto the whole subject line.  The Request- header line has its final\nnewline removed, the contents up to the colon substituted into\nnonexistence, and saves the rest in the addressee variable.\n\nNext the pipe to sendmail is opened and its output is selected so that\nall print commands will go to the pipe.  There is a comment for a\ndifferent output channel to the file foo which can be commented in for\ntesting.\n\nNext the remailed header is constructed out of print statements.\n\nLastly the rest of the standard input is passed through unmodified to\nthe output channel.  The while loop terminates when there is no more\ninput.\n\n---------\n\n4. sendmail\n\nsendmail is the backend mailer; it expects complete mail messages and\ndoes not usually generate any line itself except for the first \"From\"\n(with no colon) line.  Any header you construct will thus get passed\nthrough mostly unmodified.  Hence you can put in any \"From:\" line you\nwant and any other header info, such as my \"Remailed-By:\" line.\n\nsendmail expects the name of the addressee on its command line,\notherwise it puts an \"Apparently-To:\" line in the header.\n\nAny mail processor which remails should probably go through sendmail,\nalthough it would also be possible to talk to an SMTP port directly,\nwere you so motivated.  MH also has some remailing programs; see 'man\nmhook'.\n\n---------\n\nA few words for tinkerers.\n\n-- You can always send mail to yourself.  Especially after you've done\none kind of mail processing and want to pass the mail through the\nfilters again.\n\n-- When getting started, create an empty .maildelivery file first and\nthen get your .forward file working.  Test it by sending messages to\nyourself.  If you're not getting them, they are going into the bit\nbucket.  All your other mail will as well, in this case, so if you\ncan't afford to lose mail, do it right the first time or work on a\nspare account.  \n\n-- Any mail slocal does not process will get delivered as normal.\nRunning a remailer will not interfere with your other work.\n\n-- Remember to use quote marks.\n\n-- You don't need to be a sysadmin to run this kind of remailer.\nThere is nothing, however, to prevent a sysadmin from running this\nsofware under an alias.  The sysadmin is also a 'trusted user' to\nsendmail and can get rid of pesky \"From\"-no-colon lines.\n\n-- Perl has a random function which could be used to automatically\nchoose various \"From:\" lines from a database.  Remember to include\nyeltsy@kremvax.rus.\n\n-- postnews or inews could be substituted for sendmail.  Different\nheader lines would have to be created.  Such a service could run in\nparallel with a remailer.  You too can now repost to alt.sex.bondage!\n\n\nEnjoy.  And watch for interesting improvements like encryption.\n\n\nEric", "body_length": 8111, "has_pgp": false, "flags": [], "parent_id": "9209220543.AA25094@soda.berkeley.edu", "children_ids": [], "is_thread_root": true, "orphan_status": "matched_by_time_proximity", "normalized_subject": "no subject", "time_proximity_days": 2, "thread_id": "thread_000569e26299d392"}, {"id": "045ff698d6846aaf", "year": 1992, "source_file": "cyp-1992.txt", "line_number": 31162, "from_raw": "tcmay@netcom.com (Timothy C.

And also anonymous \"escrow services\" which are like banks but\nwhich serve other functions, such as holding the money in a\ntransaction so that Alice cannot take the money from Bob and refuse to\ndeliver on her side of the deal.\n\nAll of these entities must be \"pseudonymous\" (a clumsy word), in that\ndigital pseudonyms are supported (a la the work of Hughes, Finney, and\nJanek Martinson) and True Names cannot be traced.\n\n> Another issue is the prospect of multiple \"banks\", each issuing their\n> own (incompatible) cash.

All of this will evolve over time.\n\n> Lots to think about here!\n> \n> Hal\n\nThat's for sure.

The importance of trading physical goods in the Crypto Anarchy\nGame.\n\nThis, in my view, has been given undue and misleading importance.\nPhysical goods are inherently easy to trace through remailers (via\nsniffers, radioactive tracers, weight of packages, and many other\nphysical cues), are hard to store physically (imagine getting 100\nparcels for later remailing), and, most importantly, have none of the\n\"envelope within envelope within....\" protection accorded to the bits\nof a cryptographic remailing, or DC-Net, system! The elegance of\ncryptographic protocols is lost with physical goods.\n\nFurthermore, physical delivery of any good, whether drugs, stolen\nmissile components, antiquities and art items, whatever, is\nfundamentally a hard problem to solve...smugglers and thieves have\nbeen dealing this since the beginning of time. Stings can be easily\narranged, delivery is not anonymous (one merely watches who takes\ndelivery, or who opens a train station locker, etc....this is all SOP\nfor narcs and counterespionage types), and a raid on a remailing\nentity will result in confiscation of the physical goods and (likely)\nprosecution of those caught holding the stuff. (Raiding a bit\nremailing entity produces only random-appearing bits...granted, the\nauthorities may well outlaw bit remailing, or use the RICO and\nconspiracy/sedition laws to prosecute, but that's another topic.)\n\nOur recent emphasis on physical goods, and all the ideas pouring in on\nwhat other kinds of \"contraband\" besides drugs can be used, is\nmisleading. None of the richness of the cryptographic world is\nfaithfully preserved. I urge we get back to our roots and deal only\nwith things that can be expressed purely in bit form. \n\n2. The \"colonization of cyberspace\" does not mean there is no\ninteraction with the physical world, of course. But that interaction\ncan be mediated with money made by converting information or digital\nmoney into physical money. Several methods for this conversion path\ncan be considered:\n\n-Alice sells information in the cyberspace domain for the equivalent\nof, say, $30,000. She converts this to \"real\" dollars by using an\nescrow entity which hold both sides of the transaction until it's\ncompleted. They then mail the information to the purchaser and send an\nordinary check \"for services rendered\" to Alice for $30K. She reports\nit on her taxes, probably as a \"consulting fee\" (for which essentially\nno government supervision currently exists, nor is likely to....), and\nthe conversion has taken place.  (Note: there are still elements of\ntrust involved, notably involving the escrow agent, but trust works\npretty well for many things, especially when reputations are at\nstake. Understanding how real businesses depend on reputations is a\nmissing part of modern cryptology analyses of transactions...the\nprotocol analyzers and number theorists almost never take into account\nhow reputations work in the real world, But I digress.)\n\n-Alice and Bob trade information such that Bob gets the information\nworth about $30K, as above, and Alice gets another piece of\ninformation she can use in the \"real world\" that is worth about $30K.\nThis might be stock tips, or, better, information she can turn around\nand sell in the \"open market\" of a service like AMIX!  There are lots\nof wrinkles, inefficiencies, etc., to be worked out.\n\n-And then there is digital money. You all know about this, or should.\nDavid Chaum, DigiCash, blinded notes, credentials, etc. The handout\nfor the first meeting had a glossary of terms. (IMHO, we should be\nspending more of our time at our meeting discussing this, and less in\nplaying more interations of the Game.)\n\nThe fascinating novel \"Snow Crash,\" by Neil Stephenson, makes a\nmistake in having Hiro Protagonist a very wealthy man in the Metaverse\n(Stephenson's term for the virtual reality cyberspace) but a very poor\nman in the Real World. Information _is_ money. Information is liquid,\nflows across borders, and is generally convertible into real money.\n(One simple conversion strategy, alluded to above, is for Alice to\nsell her information for, say, $500K, and then to receive a\n\"consulting contract,\" perhaps called a \"retainer,\" of $50K a year for\nthe next 20 years. Her retainer is fully legal, is perhaps handled\nthrough cut-outs who specialize in this kind of thing, and is a\nlow-risk way to \"launder\" money from cyberspace into the real world. I\nhave a lot more to say on these schemes, perhaps later.)\n\n3. Are we emphasizing \"The Game\" too much?\n\nIf the goal is to produce a paper-based game, similar to \"Monopoly\" or\nfantasy role-playing games, then I suppose more practice is needed.\nBut I'm not sure how worthwhile it is to try to design such a game.\n(Those who wish to should do so, then commercialize it, and become the\nAvalon Hill of crypto games!)\n\nIf the goal is educational, for newly interested folks, then I also\nquestion how much more effort should be put into it. The ideas of\nanonymous remailers, of digital money, etc., are, I think, gotten\nacross in the first 60 minutes of the game, especially if some of the\nformalism is first explained (as it was at the first game, where\ndigital mixes, tamper-resistand modules for implementing mixes, the\n\"Dining Cryptographers Protocol,\" and digital money had all been\nfreshly covered, so participants were putting the theory to test).\n\n\nI found the first game was instructive, the second much less so (and\n_not_ because of the focus on drug selling...that was a relatively\nminor issue). My impression is that many of the newcomers--and they\nshould jump in here with their own reactions (too bad we don't have\nhypertext links!)--didn't really know how remailing mixes work, how\ndigital psueodnyms can protect privacy in transactions, and how the\n\"Game\" was intended to exercise these concepts.\n\n4. We need to talk about the charter or purpose of the \"Cypherpunks\"\nor \"Cryptology Amateurs for Social Irresponsibility\" (CASI--Eric\nHughes's term) group.\n\n-Is it mostly educational?\n-Is it a lobbying group, as are EFF, CPSR, and the like?\n-Is it to produce remailers, digital money, and other programming?\n-Is it subversive?\n\nNow clearly we can't say it's subversive (any bets on who's gatewaying\nthese messages to Other Listeners?). But we also don't want to skew\nthings toward \"YALG\" (Yet Another Lobbying Group), nor do we want to\nbe a spoon-feeding educational group for people with a casual (and\ntransient) interest in crypto stuff.\n\n5. There have have been several messages so far about worries about\nthe legal implications of these topics, about how some\ncorporate-affiliated subscribers will desubscribe \"real fast\" if\ncertain discussion trends continue, and so on. Now we can't please\neverybody, but maybe we ought to talk about this sensitive issue soon,\nand _in person_.\n\nSince it relates to our charter, Point 4 above, I recommend we do this\nat our next meeting. I'd favor that over another iteration of the\nGame.\n\nIn conclusion, we are in at the beginning of Something Big. While I'm\nsomewhat skeptical about the claims for things like nanotech, I see\nthis whole cyberspace/cryptology/digital money/transnationalism ball of\nwax being _much_ easier to implement. Networks are multiplying beyond\nany hope of government control, bandwidths are skyrocketing, CPUs are\nputting awesome power on our desktops, PGP is generating incredible\ninterest, and social trends are making the time right for crypto\nanarchy.\n\nI look forward to hearing your views.\n\n\n--\n..........................................................................\nTimothy C.

This is a problem for an official, legal, profit-making\nbusiness which wants to engage in electronic banking.\n\nHowever, such a business would face many other problems.  Chaum's\ndigital cash system could be construed as using the RSA algorithms,\nsince it is in effect an RSA signature which makes the cash\nunforgeable.  So a license for RSA would have to be obtained as well.\n(RSA licensing would also be needed for secure communication between\nthe bank and its customers.)\n\nIn addition, the acceptable use policies of NSFNET, which would\nprobably have to be involved in most communications with the bank,\nare inconsistent with this kind of commercial activity, from what I\nunderstand.  I believe new policies are in the works to allow\ncommercial activities on the net, but these again will involve\nlicensing costs.\n\nThere is also the question of the legality of private cash in any\nform, electronic or otherwise.  Nobody seems to have hard evidence on\nthis.  On the one hand, people can legally exchange certain types of\nsecurities, and they could perform services for each other in return\nfor such exchanges.  This is legal, but they are supposed to report\nthe income on their tax returns.  Our digital cash would seem to fit\nthis model.  (But are such securities transfers as untraceable as\ndigital cash?  Perhaps not.)\n\nOn the other hand, I read several years ago that casino chips in Las\nVegas were starting to be used as cash substitutes, but that the\ngovernment cracked down on this practice.  Perhaps this was too\nconducive to money laundering, especially with the reputed underworld\nactivity in that city.\n\nI do think, though, that an informal digital cash system, presented as\na research project or an educational game, would be able to slip\nbetween the cracks of the legal system, much as PGP has done.  And I\nthink this presentation would be legitimate.  Digital cash is new\n(actually, nonexistant, as far as I know), and any use of it would by\nits very nature be research and be educational.\n\nI would suggest that anyone who proposes to implement such a game\nmight want to consider releasing it anonymously (actually,\npseudonymously).  Sign the release with a PGP or RIPEM key, and let\nthat be your pseudonym.  Let people post messages to alt.security.pgp\nor some other newsgroup to discuss it, so that you can read them\nwithout revealing yourself, as proposed by Yanek.

Since  the standard is classified,  the\n          contractors can not sell the equipment to non-secure governmental\n          agencies or the public.

Some of these devices\n          are  specifically   designed  for   bench  marking   TEMPEST\n          Certified equipment.  This does not  solve the problem.

This document  specifies the  emanations\n          levels suitable  for Certification.   The  document is  only\n          available  to United  States  contractors having  sufficient\n          security  clearance  and  an  ongoing  contract  to  produce\n          TEMPEST Certified computers  for the  government.   Further,\n          the correct levels are specified by the NSA and there  is no\n          assurance that, while these levels are sufficient to prevent\n          eavesdropping by unfriendly operatives,  equipment certified\n          under NACSIM  5100A will have  levels low enough  to prevent\n          eavesdropping by the NSA itself.\n               The  accessibility  of  supposedly  correct  emanations\n          levels  does  not solve  the  problem of  preventing TEMPEST\n          eavesdropping.

The\ndifference is that such a monitoring sysop would not be able to read\nreplies.  Why?  Because the private keys are kept on the originating\nboard.\n\nBut it sounds as though you're trying to prevent against external\nmonitoring and that you trust your sysops.  In this case there is no\nadvantage to issuing keys to individuals; it's just not worth the\neffort.\n\nLoyd:\n>I don't have my user's terminal program -- I *do* have the bbs software.\n\nThis is the unfortunate fact of the situation, I acknowledge.  But do\nyou know what terminal programs are in the most common use?  I suspect\nmost of this stuff could be done with script programming in the\nvarious terminal packages.\n\nDo you know, in aggregate, how many users of each terminal program you\nhave?  You can poll your users to find out.  You'll need this data to \nallocate your effort.\n\nAnd you've got lots of people willing to help, even if they can't\nbecause they are working on other projects.  Everyone on this list,\nfor example.  Let me repeat, for those of you who did not previously\nknow you were willing to help.  Everyone on this list should be\nwilling to help Loyd write scripts for his users to use PGP.  \n\nCypherpunks write code.\n\nThis will mean someone who knows Procomm, Crosstalk, Qmodem, Telix,\netc.  for the PC, someone who knows the various Mac, Amiga, Atari, and\nother machines.  This will mean someone to write nice pretty visual\ninterfaces for PGP to put all the PGP options on menus where they are\nall visible.  This will mean people to think about BBS/terminal\nprotocols.  This will mean lots of individual contributions, no single\nof which need be large, but whose sum will be.\n\nEric", "body_length": 2607, "has_pgp": false, "flags": [], "parent_id": "9210201753.AA009kv@fnordbox.UUCP", "children_ids": ["2580@eternity.demon.co.uk"], "is_thread_root": false, "orphan_status": "has_parent", "normalized_subject": "keystone", "thread_id": "thread_88efe666c7e351ce"}, {"id": "31107a6db54bfd6e", "year": 1992, "source_file": "cyp-1992.txt", "line_number": 44764, "from_raw": "gnu (John Gilmore)", "from_name": "gnu (John Gilmore)", "from_email": "gnu@toad.com", "date_raw": "Thu, 10 Dec 92 03:03:08 PST", "date_parsed": "1992-12-10T03:03:08-08:00", "subject": "No more PGP keys without signatures, please!", "message_id": "9212101103.AA02644@toad.com", "in_reply_to": "9212080624.AA17822@soda.berkeley.edu", "references": [], "to": "cypherpunks@toad.com", "cc": "", "content_type": "text/plain", "body": "People continue to post PGP keys that are not vouched for by anyone.\nE.g. none of the keys for remailers has any signatures.

Abstract\n\nThis memo defines a framework for interaction between MIME and PEM services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpires May 16, 1993\t[Page 1]\n\n\n\n\n\ndraft\tMIME-PEM Interaction\tNov 92\n\n\n3. Introduction\n\nIn the Internet community, an electronic mail message has two parts: the headers and the body. The headers form a collection of field/value pairs structured according to RFC 822 [1], whilst the body, if structured, is defined according to Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) [2]. \n\nPrivacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) [3-6] allows encryption and authentication services to be applied to an electronic mail message.\n\nThis memo defines a framework whereby the services provided by MIME and PEM are used in a complementary fashion. \n\nIn order to provide for MIME-PEM interaction, two content types, \"multipart/pem\" and \"application/pem\", are defined. Then, the relationship between MIME and PEM is described in terms of two functions: message composition and message delivery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpires May 16, 1993\t[Page 2]\n\n\n\n\n\ndraft\tMIME-PEM Interaction\tNov 92\n\n\n4. Definiton of new Content Types\n\n\n4.1. Definition of the multipart/pem Content Type \n\n(1) MIME type name: multipart\n\n(2) MIME subtype name: pem\n\n(3) Required parameters: boundary, privacy \n\n(4) Optional parameters: none\n\n(5) Encoding considerations: always 7bit \n\n(6) Security Considerations: see [3]\n\n\nThis subtype of multipart always contains two body parts: the first is an arbitrary content; and, the second is an application/pem content which describes the privacy- enhancements which resulted in the first body part. \n\nThe value of the first body part corresponds to <pemtext> as defined in [3]. Note that if <pemtext> is represented using the base64 encoding, then a a Content-Transfer-Encoding: header is present which indicates use of the base64 content encoding. Otherwise, if a Content-Transfer-Encoding: header is present, it indicates use of the 7bit content encoding. \n\nThe syntax and semantics of the boundary parameter is defined in [2].\n\nThe syntax of the privacy parameter, using the ABNF notation of [1], is:\n\nprivacy-value ::= \"ENCRYPTED\"\n/ \"MIC-ONLY\"\n/ \"MIC-CLEAR\"\n\nwith each value conveying the intent as specified in [3]. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpires May 16, 1993\t[Page 3]\n\n\n\n\n\ndraft\tMIME-PEM Interaction\tNov 92\n\n\n4.2. Definition of the application/pem Content Type \n\n(1) MIME type name: application\n\n(2) MIME subtype name: pem\n\n(3) Required parameters: none\n\n(4) Optional parameters: none\n\n(5) Encoding considerations: always 7bit \n\n(6) Security Considerations: see [3]\n\n\nThe syntax of this content type corresponds to the <pemhdr> production defined in [3].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpires May 16, 1993\t[Page 4]\n\n\n\n\n\ndraft\tMIME-PEM Interaction\tNov 92\n\n\n5. Message Composition\n\nWhen a user composes a message, it is the responsibility of the user agent to use the Content-Type: header. This allows the receiving user agent to unambiguously interpret the body and process it accordingly.\n\nThis memo introduces a new header field, \"Content-Privacy\", which is used to indicate that the message should undergo privacy-enhancement prior to submission. The syntax of this header field corresponds to the <privacy-value> production defined above.\n\n\n5.1. Pre-Submission Algorithm\n\nPrior to submission, the user agent applies this algorithm: \n\n(1) If the content does not contain the Content-Privacy: \nheader, then the user agent sees if the content is either multipart or message. If so, it then recursively applies this algorithm to the encapsulated body parts; if not, it terminates processing for this content.\n\n(2) If the content does contain the Content-Privacy: header, \nthe content is transformed from local form to its canonical form. Note that if a Content-Transfer- Encoding: header is present, then the content encoding is reversed as a part of this process.\n\n(3) If the canonical form of the content uses octet values \noutside of the NVT ASCII repertoire, and if the value of the Content-Privacy: header is MIC-CLEAR, then this inconsistency is reported to the user and the algorithm aborts.\n\n(4) Otherwise, the privacy-enhancement indicated by the \nContent-Privacy: header is performed, constructing a new content. The Content- headers, other than Content- Transfer-Encoding: and Content-Privacy:, are taken from the original content, if any.\n\n(5) If the value of the Content-Privacy: header is not MIC- \nCLEAR, then the base64 content encoding is applied and a Content-Transfer-Encoding: header is added to the new \n\n\n\n\n\nExpires May 16, 1993\t[Page 5]\n\n\n\n\n\ndraft\tMIME-PEM Interaction\tNov 92\n\n\ncontent.\n\n(6) Finally, a multipart/pem content is constructed, whcih \ncontains the new content and a corresponding application/pem content. The multipart/pem content replaces the original content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpires May 16, 1993\t[Page 6]\n\n\n\n\n\ndraft\tMIME-PEM Interaction\tNov 92\n\n\n6. Message Delivery\n\nWhen a user receives a message containing an multipart/pem content, the user agent may transform the content back into its original content type. This operation, the post-delivery algorithm, is performed by reversing the steps performed during the pre-submission algorithm.\n\nWhen the original content is reconstituted into canonical form, it may use octet values outside of the NVT ASCII repertoire. If the user agent replaces the multipart/pem content with the original content, then it must select an appropriate transfer encoding and include the appropriate Content-Transfer-Encoding: header.\n\n\nUpon successful completion of the post-delivery algorithm for each content, the user agent adds a new header field, \"Content-Annotation\", which is used to indicate the privacy- enhancements that were in effect when the content was submitted. The syntax of this header field, using the ABNF notation of [1], is:\n\ncontent-annotation ::= \"Content-Annotation\" \":\" \nannotation-value\n\nannotation-value ::= <privacy-value> \";\" <date-time> \n\nwith <privacy-value> corresponding to the privacy-enhancements that was in effect during submission, and <date-time>, defined in [1], indicates the date and time that the privacy- enhancements were verified by the receiving user agent. \n\nNOTE\nIt must be strongly emphasized that the user's level of trust in the value of the Content-Annotation: header should be no higher than the user's level of trust in the message store employed by the user agent. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpires May 16, 1993\t[Page 7]\n\n\n\n\n\ndraft\tMIME-PEM Interaction\tNov 92\n\n\n7. An Example\n\nFor example, suppose the following message was being readied for submission:\n\nDate: Thu, 12 Nov 1992 21:43:40 -0800\nFrom: scrocker@tis.com\nTo:\tned@innosoft.com\nSubject: example #1\nMIME-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii Content-Privacy: mic-clear\n\nHi Ned.

See how much nicer this works!\n\nOf course, as the message being submitted was only plain text, the Content-Type: header could be ommitted. In that case, after applying the pre-submission algorithm, the message submitted for delivery would appear as:\n\nDate: Thu, 12 Nov 1992 21:43:40 -0800\nFrom: scrocker@tis.com\nTo:\tned@innosoft.com\nSubject: example #1\nMIME-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: multipart/pem; boundary=\"next-part\"; \nprivacy=mic-clear\n\nHi Ned.

Observations\n\nThe use of the pre-submission and post-delivery algorithms exhibit several properties:\n\n(1) It allows privacy-enhancement of an arbitrary content, \nnot just an RFC 822 message.\n\n(2) For a multipart or message content, it allows the user to \ndecide whether the structure of the content should receive privacy-enhancement.\n\n(3) It allows a message to contain several privacy enhanced \ncontents, thereby removing the requirement for PEM software to be able to generate or interpret a single content which intermixes both unenhanced and enhanced components.\n\n(4) It minimizes confusion when viewing a MIC-CLEAR content \nwithout a PEM-capable user agent.\n\n(5) It minimizes confusing when viewing a MIC-ONLY content \nwith a MIME-capable user agent that is not PEM-capable. \n\n\n9.

Sometimes these \"manual\" methods work pretty well!\n--Tim May)\n\n\nTim,\n\tI have been following your arguments in CypherPunks.\n\nThe name will turn off a lot of your natural friends, but your arguments are\ndead on.  The Crux of the matter is digital cash.  And getting\nthese anonymous remailers working.  PGP is a basic enabling\nthing.  Not that RSA hasn't been around forever, but it\njust wasn't useable without a standard.  My deepest gratitude\nto you and your friends.\n\nThe remailer business needs to get standardized also.  My personal\nhack is attached below.  One problem not addressed in the first\ncrop of remailers is the problem of how do you handle return\npaths.  There are lots of trivial ways to get anonymous outgoing\nmail. Most telephone systems do not identify the caller, there are\nlots of other ways to get this function.  But the problem is getting\nan answer back with out unmasking.  The mathematicians may be able to\nconjure up a better scheme, but I see the backward security to be\nsimply a matter of tearing the connection (return path down) faster\nthan it can be backtraced.  It would be nicer if some kind of\nDC-net return path could be devised.  But timeout control will \ndefinitely work. With a large number of the forwaring nodes, and\nmulti-hop paths, it would become quickly very impractical to shake\ndown the originator,  So the return path could be left \"up\" for \nquite some time before having to replace it.  Certainly long enough\nfor a reasonable reply.  Better yet of cource would be a completely\nuncrackable return path that you could leave up long enough to use\ninstitutional advertising.  Eg: run a business from.\n\nAnother way to leave up long lasting connections (return paths)\nis to select one really HARD point node.  This is the one they\nhave to shake down first.  And use continuously shifting paths\nbehind that node.  (all sounds like a router ? ) \n\nIf you could repost this anonymously\nI sure would appreciate it.  I am  (ahem, respectable), and have\nsome kids left to feed. \n\nCould you tell me how to find out more about David Chaum's work?\n\ndo you have an email address for him, is he on one of the mailers,\nor have anything published?\n\nMy hunch is that this whole business could heat up fast.  Within just a\nfew years the government could be forced into \"wage/price\" controls.\nA great application for the NREN?\n\nThanks,  xxxxxxxx@yyyyyy.zzz\n\n---------Tear off  -----\n\nThis is a proposal for a simple anonymous forwarding protocol.\n\n1>  With the exception of cases 4> and 5> below:\n\n    Any message addressed to the forwarding node that does not\n    contain a valid PGP encrypted block, encrypted with the \n    node's public key causes the forwarding node to reply to\n    the sender with its public key, plus whatever other \n    text the node wishes to add.\n\n2>  If a properly encrypted message is decrypted with the node's\n    secret key; The body of the decrypted message is scanned\n    for the following sequence:\n\n    \"Please forward this message to:\"  FORWARD.ADDRESS  \"Thank you.\"\n\n    The trigger strings are what is shown above in the quote marks\n    but not including the quote marks.

I don't have any incentive\nto find the precise place in the books where it says you can't have an\nanonymous account in the US, but for a few hundred bucks in easy money\nI'd find it fairly quickly.

Easy often turns out to be six months of work all by itself.\n\nWhy should \"hard\" be that much more difficult? Looks like an extra few\ndays worth of work if you pull all the public key code from PGP.\nAdmittedly, this would be a big project if one couldn't steal existinc\ndode, but remember, PGP is copyleft. This whole project is a humungous\npatent violation anyway, so there is no good reason for not stealing\ncode from PGP. Phil's code is bloody good.\n\nAnyway, the \"easy\" protection is probably the \"hardest\" part. Getting\nthe encrypted link and drivers running properly is the big deal --\nthats the code that will take all the time. Its likely marginal cost\nto design the protocol \"right\" from the beginning to make it easy to\nplug in verification later, and being able to use existing public key\ncode to implement it likely removes most of the sting.\n\nAll you have to do in order to \"fix\" things is have both sides public\nkey encrypt their D-H exchanges, and suddenly, you have verification\nof identity.\n\n>> suggest that the protocol be designed so that it does not reveal the\n>> entities forming the link to outsiders (unless one end should\n>> intentionally advertise who it is...\n\n>This is the intent.

Even if all the crypto operations were done in the\ndongle, it wouldn't be a \"turnkey\" device that could operate totally\nautomatically.  You'd still need a way for your host computer to turn\nit off and on, to select a public key for encryption or signature\nverification, to load new public keys, etc. I.e., you'd have to run\nspecial driver software on the host anyway. So why not limit the\ndongle to the specific purpose for which it was designed (protecting\nyour RSA secret key) and do the less sensitive operations where memory\nand cycles are far more plentiful, i.e., on the host?\n\nLimiting the dongle's function to RSA secret key operations also\nminimizes the dongle's communication requirements.  The only data\nyou'd have to send to it in normal operation would be short blocks to\nbe run through your RSA secret key operation, a heavily compute-bound\nprocess. If I want to decrypt a file, I'd send the dongle the IDEA (or\nDES) key that had been encrypted with my public key. Once the dongle\nresponds with the decrypted IDEA key, I can perform the actual IDEA\ndecryption on my host computer with no further dongle interaction.\nRegardless of the file size, this would go at host CPU and/or disk\nspeed, not the speed of the port that's talking to the dongle.\n\nSimilarly for signing -- the MD-5 hashing of the file would proceed at\nnear disk speed (since MD-5 is so fast) and only the resulting hash\ncode would have to be passed to the dongle for the RSA secret key\nstep.\n\nA palmtop DOS machine like the HP-95 or Atari Portfolio would make a\ngood platform for a prototype dongle.  Most have serial ports\n(standard or optional), and you could just plug them into a spare\nserial port on a PC (again, speed is not critical). The palmtop's\nkeypad would be used to control the dongle, e.g., by accepting a pass\nphrase to decrypt the stored copy of your RSA secret key, so you\nwouldn't have to type it into a possibly compromised PC. And they're\nsmall enough to carry around with you, thus making it harder for\nsomebody to hack.\n\nThe only drawback I can see to all of this is that palmtops are not\nexactly speed demons, and RSA secret key operations are pretty slow to\nbeing with (much slower than the public key operations, which are less\nsensitive). But secret key operations are the heart of RSA, so you\ndon't have much choice if you want real security.\n\nSince it is a sensitive step, RSA key generation could also be done on\nthe palmtop (although it would probably take hours) or it could be\ndone on an external, trusted PC and loaded into the palmtop. If your\nmain reason for using the dongle is to limit the trust you have to\nplace in a borrowed PC (as opposed to protecting against your own home\nPC being hacked), this may be a reasonable thing to do.\n\nAnother idea just occurred to me. If you have a trusted machine (e.g.\nyour home PC) available to you over the net, you could use it as a\n\"remote dongle\". You'd send it data to be run through the RSA secret\nkey operation and it would return it. Obviously, to be secure the\nnetwork exchanges would have to be encrypted in both directions,\notherwise anybody could either pick up the \"remote dongle's\" responses\nor worse, send it data of his own choosing. A simple symmetric cipher\n(IDEA, DES) would be adequate here since you control both ends of the\nlink.\n\nThe main drawback of this approach (other than the need for network\nconnectivity) is the physical vulnerability of your unattended home\nPC.\n\nPhil", "body_length": 3711, "has_pgp": false, "flags": [], "parent_id": null, "children_ids": ["9211280216.AA05139@novavax.nova.edu", "9211280249.AA10136@servo"], "is_thread_root": true, "orphan_status": "true_root", "normalized_subject": "more comments on dongles", "thread_id": "thread_60c6f6c81e6a4f20"}, {"id": "079489ededd2ff88", "year": 1992, "source_file": "cyp-1992.txt", "line_number": 36392, "from_raw": "VANGUARD@gribb.hsr.no", "from_name": null, "from_email": "vanguard@gribb.hsr.no", "date_raw": "Fri, 27 Nov 92 16:37:46 PST", "date_parsed": "1992-11-27T16:37:46-08:00", "subject": "Random numbers", "message_id": "MAILQUEUE-101.921128014051.448@gribb.hsr.no", "in_reply_to": null, "references": [], "to": "cypherpunks@toad.com", "cc": "", "content_type": "text/plain", "body": "It has lately been discussed different ways to construct pure\nrandom number generators by means of radiactive decay.

The way to do\nthis would too have a weak random number generator like:\nR(n+1)=(17*R(n)+1)mod256, and then inject the pure random into this\nfunction giving the result R(n+1)=(17*R(n)+1+PR(t))mod256 or\nsomething of the like.\n\n    Would this constitute a sufficiently secure stream of data for\nuse in one time pads? Has this been thought of before ?\n\n\n\nTHE REST OF THIS MESSAGE CAN BE SAFELY INGNORED:\n\n    A friend of mine now serving in the air force gave me a report of\nthe cryptographic devices used for communicating on permanent lines.\n(Twisted pair or something dug down). The machines used till now are\nhuge totaly outdated mostly mechanical monsters. While not\ntransmitting data the machines produce random data to hinder traffic\nanalysys (like how many messages are sent), these data are produced\nby cookiebox sized thing, and I strongly suspect it to be of a very\nmechanical nature. Thats how a came up with the idea of a very\ninexpensive way to produce random data by mechanical means: Use a\ncontaner filled with marbles some made of conducting, and some of non-\nconducting material. Then mix them in some way or another (this is\nbound to make a lot of noise) and in the container there should be a\nfew closely placed points of contact that would be able to send a\nsmall current through a steel ball if it where to pass over the pair\nof contacts, and what do we have: Random Data !

Start reading your\nmail as you usually would.\n\nAny time an encrypted message is displayed whose public key ID matches\none of the private keys on your keyring, the dongle temporarily buffers\nthe message it into its RAM, flashes the \"decrypt\" LED, while\ndecrypting the message.  Then you can view the plaintext using a\nsimple, terminal-independent pager that lets you go forward/back one\npage, and search for a key word.  When you are done, you press Q, and\nthe plaintext is immediately deleted from the memory.  Note that during\nall this, the plaintext did not appear anywhere on the host or any of\nthe communication links connecting you to it.\n\nLet's say you want to reply to a message.  Press 'r' or whatever key is\nused to reply in your particular mail reader.\n\nOr if you want to send a message, press 'm' and fill in the address.\n\nThen, if your editor is something like vi or ed that requires you to do\nsomething before you can input text (like press 'a') then do that.  If\nyou use an editor like EMACS or SMiLE or jove or cat or anything that\nlets you just type in text, you skip this step.\n\nNow, press the \"encrypt\" button on the dongle.  It presents you with a\nsimple line editor, that works with any terminal or terminal emulation,\nbut is reasonably easy to use (something like most bbs-es use for\ncomposing messages).  You type your message, or if it was prepared\nahead of time on the local equipment, you transmit the text.\n\nNOTE: this is the simpler of the several different approaches to plaintext\nhandling that I am considering.\n\nWhen you are done, you pick the public key to encrypt it with (or it\ncan be automatically determined based on the address you typed in to\nyour mail program previously).  If you have lots of public keys, you\ncould use a search to quickly find the one you want.\n\nThen you have the option of signing the message with any one of the\nprivate keys that you have.\n\nFinally, the dongle transmits the cyphertext to the host, and you type\nthe _exit_ key sequence for the editor (:wq, or C-x C-c, or /done,\netc).\n\nThe message is sent by the mailer software on the host.\n\nThen you may want to scan a newsgroup like alt.w.a.s.t.e for any mail\nthat may be for you.  Put your dongle into \"WASTE SCAN\" mode (for\nexample by pressing *WS on the keypad) and tell your newsreader\nsomething like \"display all new messages\".  The dongle will detect a\nmessage whose key-id matches one of the keys on your key-ring decrypts\nand displays it, while ignoring all the other messages that are not for\nyou.  You must retrieve all the messages, so that anyone monitoring\nyour activity has no way of knowing which one, if any, was actually\naddressed to you.\n\nThen you receive a \"talk\" request (or a chat call on a bbs, or you may\nbe on irc or a MUD with \"chat mode\") from someone you know has a\nsimilar device (or software that emulates it).\n\nIf you both know each other's public keys, the two devices both\ngenerate a random session key and encrypt it with the others' public\nkey.\n\nIf not, a key-exchange protocol may be used to generate a key both of\nyou know, but that can not be later recovered by someone recording the\ndata.\n\nNow the dongles encrypt any text (one line at at time) that you type,\nand decrypt anything received.\n\nMany other applications for a portable, trusted crypto engine could be\nthought of, given time.\n\n\n--\nYanek Martinson    mthvax.cs.miami.edu!safe0!yanek     uunet!medexam!yanek\nthis address preferred -->> yanek@novavax.nova.edu <<-- this address preferred\nPhone (305) 765-6300 daytime   FAX: (305) 765-6708  1321 N 65 Way/Hollywood\n      (305) 963-1931 evenings       (305) 981-9812  Florida, 33024-5819", "body_length": 4206, "has_pgp": false, "flags": [], "parent_id": null, "children_ids": ["9211290756.AA14123@toad.com", "9211292126.AA22394@deathtongue.MIT.EDU"], "is_thread_root": true, "orphan_status": "true_root", "normalized_subject": "detailed scenario of dongle usage", "thread_id": "thread_f960ad6905d6a574"}, {"id": "08e2944d25412071", "year": 1992, "source_file": "cyp-1992.txt", "line_number": 43332, "from_raw": "tcmay@netcom.com (Timothy C.

Long term, there will be a FAQ, to be coordinated by Hugh Daniel,\nwho recently posted about this.\n\n2. I posted or mentioned the following items to this list very recently:\n\n- Crypto Glossary (which explains, albeit briefly, RSA, digital cash,\nDC-Nets, PGP, etc.). This has been also been submitted for the\nanonymous ftp site (at soda.berkeley.edu in pub/cypherpunks).\n\n- Larry Loen's crypto FAQ he posted to sci.crypt recently. This was\nalso submitted for the  ftp site.\n\n3. The documentation for PGP has a good discussion of the issues, how\nthe IDEA cipher works, etc. Read this, please, before asking the\nentire list how RSA works.\n\n4. \"Cypherpunks read crypto books\" is my variant of Eric's\n\"Cypherpunks write code.\" (No point in trying to write code if you\ndon't have any idea what you're doing.) I've described many excellent\nbooks and articles. Almost any recent book will give you an excellent\nlist of other books.\n\n5. Hal Finney and Karl Barrus have both written excellent summaries\nof how digital cash works. Work through their examples! (A personal\nnote: I'm blissfully PERL-illiterate, but I use Mathematica on my Mac,\nso Karl's examples in Mathematica overjoyed me!)\n\n6. Several weeks ago I posted some articles on the dining\ncryptographers protocol, as Hal also did. I can send these to anyone\nwho wasn't on the list then. (Ditto for the Crypto Glossary.)\n\n7. Sci.crypt is worth reading, especially if you have a good\nnewsreader like \"tin\" which allows interesting threads to be quickly\nidentified. \n\nHope this helps.\n\n--Tim\n\n\n-- \n..........................................................................\nTimothy C.

If you were\nheading north on 101, you just come right off the exit to the\nstoplight.  The light is the intersection of Amphitheatre and\nCharleston Rd.  Take a right on Charleston; there's a right-turn-only\nlane.\n\nFollow Charleston for a short distance.  You'll pass the\nMetaphor/Kaleida buildings on the right.  At a clump of palm trees and\na \"Landmark Deli\" sign, take a right into Landings Drive.  At the end\nof the road, turn left into the complex with the big concrete\n\"Landmark\" sign.  Follow the road past the deli til you are in front\nof the clock tower that rises out of one of the buildings, facing you.\nEnter through the doors immediately under the clock tower.  They'll be\nopen between noon and 1PM at least.  (See below if you're late.)\n\nOnce inside, take the stairs up, immediately to your right.  At the top\nof the stairs, turn right past the treetops, and we'll be in 1937 on \nyour left.  The door is marked \"Cygnus\".\n\nIf you are late and the door under the clock tower is locked, you can\nwalk to the deli (which will be around the building on your left, as\nyou face the door).

They can be\nbeeped at 965 5250, though you'll have trouble finding a phone.\n\nDon't forget to eat first, or bring food at noon!  I recommend hitting\nthe burrito place on Rengstorff (La Costen~a) at about 11:45.  To get\nthere, when you get off 101, take Rengstorff (toward the hills) rather\nthan Amphitheatre (toward the bay).  Follow it about ten blocks until\nthe major intersection at Middlefield Road.

You can turn left into the narrow lane\nbehind the store, which leads to a parking lot, and enter by the front\ndoor, which faces the intersection.

This proposed standard, known as MIME (for Multipurpose\nInternet Mail Extensions) is nearly complete and will allow rich text,\nbinary and other formats to be included in a single internet mail message.\nThere has been a disagreement between the PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail) and\nMIME communities as to which should be integrated into the other;  simply\nput, the PEM folk feel that you simply encrypt an entire MIME message, and\nthe MIME folk think that PEM messages are just another one of the many\ntypes of content parts that a MIME message can contain.\n\nI tend to agree with the latter camp, as it appears to be more flexible.\nFor example, what happens if I wish to start communications with someone\nusing a different standard than PGP (gasp - they may be using RSA's\nmailsafe), or even a newer, perhaps incompatible version of PGP?  Or \nmaybe I want to send them a message partly encrypted and partly in the \nclear?  MIME is designed to handle these scenarios (and more).\n\nI must admit that this thought coalesced in my head due to the confluence \nof two different streams of communications both heading towards this\nsolution at the same time:\n\n1)  I asked Steve Dorner (author of the excellent Eudora Macintosh email \n    reader) if he was considering adding encryption to his mailer \n    (specifically PGP) and he replied no, but that he was integrating \n    MIME into it;\n    \n2)  The pem-dev email list, which has been discussing threads on PGP and \n    MIME, recently carried an interesting proposal on MIME-PEM integration\n    (though I expect to see the other camp come out with their PEM-MIME \n    integration plan soon!).\n    \nI think this latter document is excellent reading, and I will forward it \nin a followup message to this one.  By the way, it has a short set of six\nreferences that I consider required reading for anyone interested in doing\nserious work on Internet mailers.\n\nIn case all this is new to you, I've included at the bottom a blurb from\nthe RFC-index explaining how to find these RFCs and more.\n\nMy $0.02.\nFen\n~~~\n\nMany RFCs are available online; if not, this is indicated by (Not online). \nOnline copies are available via FTP or Kermit from NIC.DDN.MIL as \nrfc/rfc####.txt or rfc/rfc####.PS (#### is the RFC number without leading \nzeroes).\n\nAdditionally, RFCs may be requested through electronic mail from the\nautomated NIC mail server by sending a message to SERVICE@NIC.DDN.MIL\nwith a subject line of \"rfc ####\" for text versions or a subject line\nof \"rfc ####.PS\" for PostScript versions.

I recall reading \"True Names\" a few years ago.  Vinge had\nhis netters exchanging mail anonymously.  The hero downloaded a big\nbatch of messages from a BBS and tried decrypting all of them to see\nwhich were for him.  Okay, I thought, that would be a way of disguising\nwhich messages you were _receiving_.  Then Vinge said something like\n\"and using more elaborate techniques, the sender of a message could\nbe hidden as well.\"  Hold on, I thought.  That will never work.  If\nthey tap your line, they're going to know exactly what messages you're\nsending.  Too bad.  Vinge had a clever idea going, but it's flawed.\n\nI only learned about Chaum's crypto stuff last year.  Somebody on the\nExtropians list mentioned PGP, and I'd always had a casual interest\nin crypto, so I downloaded it and played with it some.  I thought it\nwas great and really got into it in a big way.\n\nThis got me interested in crypto in general, so I started doing some\nlibrary research.  When I found Chaum's stuff, it just blew me away.\nThe first article I found, I think, was his CACM paper which is an\noverview of many of the things that are possible.  I started trying to\ntrack down other papers by Chaum.  Here were all the technologies\nneeded to make Vinge's world work, technologies which Vinge apparently\nknew about long before I did.\n\nIt seemed so obvious to me.  Here we are faced with the problems of\nloss of privacy, creeping computerization, massive databases, more\ncentralization - and Chaum offers a completely different direction to\ngo in, one which puts power into the hands of individuals rather than\ngovernments and corporations.  The computer can be used as a tool to\nliberate and protect people, rather than to control them.  Unlike the\nworld of today, where people are more or less at the mercy of credit\nagencies, large corporations, and governments, Chaum's approach balances\npower between individuals and organizations.  Both kinds of groups are\nprotected against fraud and mistreatment by the other.\n\nNaturally, in today's society, with power allocated so disproportionately,\nsuch ideas are a threat to large organizations.  Balancing power would\nmean a net loss of power for them.  So no institution is going to pick\nup and champion Chaum's ideas.  It's going to have to be a grass-roots\nactivity, one in which individuals first learn of how much power they\ncan have, and then demand it.\n\nWhere do the remailers fit in?  They represent the \"ground floor\" of this\nhouse of ideas - the ability to exchange messages privately, without\nrevealing our true identities.  In this way we can engage in transactions,\nshow credentials, and make deals, without government or corporate databases\ntracking our every move as they can today.  Only by securing the ability to\ncommunicate privately and anonymously can we take the next steps towards\na world in which we each have true ownership and control over information\nabout our lives.\n\nChaum's ACM paper is titled, provocatively, \"Security Without Identification -\nTransaction Systems to Make Big Brother Obsolete.\"  The work we are doing\nhere, broadly speaking, is dedicated to this goal of making Big Brother\nobsolete.  It's important work.  If things work out well, we may be able\nto look back and see that it was the most important work we have ever done.\n\nHal Finney\n74076.1041@compuserve.com", "body_length": 3608, "has_pgp": false, "flags": [], "parent_id": null, "children_ids": ["9211162333.AA10951@soda.berkeley.edu", "9211160243.AA07165@tree.egr.uh.edu", "3744.2B07398C@fidogate.FIDONET.ORG"], "is_thread_root": true, "orphan_status": "true_root", "normalized_subject": "why remailers...", "thread_id": "thread_7109d87a7d43b63d"}, {"id": "670740650d28d829", "year": 1992, "source_file": "cyp-1992.txt", "line_number": 54484, "from_raw": "yanek@novavax.nova.edu (Yanek Martinson)", "from_name": "Yanek Martinson", "from_email": "yanek@novavax.nova.edu", "date_raw": "Tue, 22 Dec 92 20:32:03 PST", "date_parsed": "1992-12-22T20:32:03-08:00", "subject": "Re: Signing ascii text", "message_id": "9212230431.AA25182@novavax.nova.edu", "in_reply_to": "9212230406.AA28094@servo", "references": [], "to": "karn@qualcomm.com (Phil Karn)", "cc": "", "content_type": "text/plain", "body": "> (e.g., email messages, etc).

The specific purpose of TEMPESTing a computer that handles\nclassified information is to contain any incidental information-\nbearing electromagnetic emissions so they cannot be received at a\ndistance. But shielding is not only a security issue, it is also\nhighly desirable to minimize interference to users of the radio\nspectrum (e.g., broadcast TV sets and radios).\n\nNow the FCC Part 15 rules (which govern \"incidental radiation devices\"\nsuch as computers) are much less stringent than TEMPEST, but this is\nonly an economic tradeoff because full TEMPEST-level shielding of a\ncomputer can be very expensive. In fact, many classified shops have\ninstead built \"screen rooms\" (or entire screened buildings, such as\nthose at the NSA) so they can use standard commercial-grade computer\nhardware. Anyone is free to add as much shielding to their computer\nequipment or their entire buildings as they want.  There's absolutely\nnothing illegal about it; in fact it's highly commendable to do so.\nThe FCC (and your neighbors) will thank you for it.\n\nNow if you wanted to \"mask\" your computer's RF emanations with some\nsort of RF noise source (such as a Tesla coil) that's another story.\nMost transmitters require licenses for the obvious reason that they\ncan interfere with other users of the radio spectrum. But this has\nnothing to do with your right (or even duty) to shield your computers.\n\nUnfortunately the TEMPEST rules themselves are classified, so we\nreally don't know how much shielding is necessary, or what one can\npick up from an unshielded system, or exactly how you'd do it.\nObviously this is an attempt to protect NSA's own SIGINT methods. But\nthere is, to coin a phrase, \"equal protection under the laws of\nphysics\".  Star Warriors' claims notwithstanding, they're the same\nfor everyone, black (classified) or white, and they're open for\nall to discover and apply on their own.\n\nPhil", "body_length": 2192, "has_pgp": false, "flags": [], "parent_id": "9212161818.AA18643@spiff.gnu.ai.mit.edu", "children_ids": [], "is_thread_root": true, "orphan_status": "matched_by_subject", "orphan_type": "no_in_reply_to", "normalized_subject": "tempest devices and use", "match_score": 15, "thread_id": "thread_195329818e421e36"}, {"id": "c4954107daec9237", "year": 1992, "source_file": "cyp-1992.txt", "line_number": 39528, "from_raw": "tytso@ATHENA.MIT.EDU (Theodore Ts'o)", "from_name": "Theodore Ts'o", "from_email": "tytso@athena.mit.edu", "date_raw": "Mon, 30 Nov 92 10:37:21 PST", "date_parsed": "1992-11-30T10:37:21-08:00", "subject": "Re: Secure Key exchange", "message_id": "9211301836.AA20482@tsx-11.MIT.EDU", "in_reply_to": "9211301332.AA10244@cs.gmu.edu", "references": [], "to": "pfarrell@cs.gmu.edu", "cc": "", "content_type": "text/plain", "body": "Date: Mon, 30 Nov 92 08:32:45 EST\n   From: pfarrell@cs.gmu.edu (Pat Farrell)\n\n   I sign keys only when I am certian that the key belongs to the human who\n   claims to have the name on the key.

Getting several forms of crypto out there is a good\ninsurance policy. The problem I see is that no system, be it OTP or\nsomething else, is likely to get much penetration in the market. PGP\nhas taken off, but another system will face an uphill battle unless it\nis very well-written, very easy to use, and/or fills some special\nneed.\n\nStill, I want to encourage George to pursue this (somehow). I have a\nCD-ROM on my Mac, but I doubt it'll be practical to burn CD-ROMs\neconomically (one service wants $200 for one CD-ROM, with a second one\nfor nominally more...and note that such a service is an obvious\nsecurity hole). 128 MB magneto-opticals may be a better bet, though\nfew folks have them.\n\nIn terms of programming energy, vis-a-vis a point John Gilmore made\nrecently about adding to the PGP effort, I'm sure enhancing PGP by\nintegrating it into standard mailers (yes, I'm aware of the security\nholes here, too) would be even more beneficial to cryptodiversity,\njust in the sense of getting the volume of encrypted traffic way up.

Make the user do an active action, rather than a\nhalf-asleep y<cr> to sign a key.\n\n\t2. store a comment in my secret ring that is captured\neach time I sign a key. Thus I could store the\n\"reason/justification\" for the signature to jog my memory. I\nknow whose key's I've signed now, but as the number gets bigger, then\nI'll need a memory aid. I suggest the secret ring, as I share\nmy public ring, and don't think that why I chose to sign a key\nshould be generally available. If this were supported, you\ncould then send me a msg asking \"why did you sign John Doe's\nkey?\" You would have to compare my answer to my published\npolicy and make your own judgement as to whether I follow it.\n\nI could keep track of this manually, and should.

But we also haven't\ngone to the other extreme of requiring some puzzle to be solved (as\nwith posting to \"alt.hackers,\" which usually requires some hacking of\nthe posting software to \"get in.\") Cracking a cypher is not a\nrequirement, though some probably think it should be.\n\nA few points:\n\n* The name \"Cypherpunks\" started out as a pun by Jude Milhon, an\neditor at \"Mondo 2000,\" when she said \"You guys are just a bunch of\ncypherpunks!\" We initially debated calling our informal group\nsomething more staid like \"The Cryptography Research Society,\" partly to\nprotect ourselves by emphasizing the \"research\" aspects, but the joke\nname stuck. So, like it or not, it's \"Cypherpunks.\" It turns off some,\nturns on others. C'est la vie. \n\n* Note that we have very little to do with the Gibsonesque vision of\npunked-out outlaws and virtual reality escapades, though in fact some\nof our members are active in Bay Area start-up companies doing VR. I\nwould say Vernor Vinge's \"True Names\" is more descriptive of what\nwe're doing.\n\n* About a hundred or so folks are on the list, including some\njournalists (gulp!), and even some \"*.mil\" sites (!!). But since what\nwe're doing is strictly \"research,\" we are of course safe.\n\n* The focus is on cryptology, anonymous remailers, hardware support,\nPGP, digital cash, \"dining cryptographers\" nets, and so on. Too much\nto recapitulate here.\n\n* By focussing on \"research\" into these areas, we feel we are safe\nagainst attack by government agencies. Time will tell. These issues of\nsecurity, privacy, remailers, digital pseudonyms, etc., are hot topics\nin the crypto community, and all we are really doing is applying these\nideas and doing experiments, the better to learn. (Some of the work on\n\"webs\" of trust in PGP systems, on issues with anonymous remailers,\nand on the development of \"digital reputations\" lies in uncharted\nterritory, that is, we're doing true research.)\n\n* Several Extropians are active on the list, as you may have gathered\nfrom cross-posts and comments.\n\n* Because many of the early members live in the Bay Area (Northern\nCalifornia, Silicon Valley), we've had three physical meetings so far.\nJohn Gilmore, a founder of Cygnus Support, has graciously offered his\nfacilities for our meetings, which typically happen on Saturday\nafternoons. The schedule gets posted on the list, of course.\n\n* Some exciting progress has already been made. Eric Hughes and Hal\nFinney have implemented a PERL-scripted remailer which provides\nanonymous forwarding (though the security is only \"manual\"), and 2-way\nremailers with digital pseudonyms seem imminent. Integrating PGP into\nmailers remains a problem, as those of you who use PGP already know,\nand several of our members are working with the PGP and MacPGP teams.\n\n* \"Crypto dongles\" to attach to RS-232 ports are being pursued by\nYanek Martinson (an Extropian as well), George Gleason, John Draper\n(\"Cap'n Crunch\"), and others. Lots of enthusiastic debate.\n\n* FIDONet users are also involved, including Tom Jennings, the founder\nof FIDONet, in 1984. This brings an exciting new flavor for most\nInternetters. \n\n* Like the Extropians list, the Cypherpunks list is relatively free\nfrom flames and personal attacks. We all realize we're interested in\nroughly the same goal, even though some are Libertarians (naturally)\nwhile others are Socialist, Marxists, and Act Up! activists.\n(Interestingly, we've never had any real flames on politics. We almost\nnever argue political views. This may of course be alien to readers of\nthe Extropians list! :-} )\n\n* So why isn't the list sent out in encrypted form? A little thought\nwill reveal the uselessness of encrypting a widely distributed list\nthat's essentially open to anyone who sends in a request! Still, there\nis some talk of encrypting in the future, partly to weed out the\ncasual readers (for whatever reason) and partly to just get the volume\nof encrypted messages up.\n\nIf you've read this far, and are really interested in joining the\nlist, send a request to \"cypherpunks-request@toad.com\". This is\nstandard list procedure, of course. But please don't then complain\nabout the list volume!\n\n\n--Tim May\n\n\n-- \n..........................................................................\nTimothy C.

The need\nfor F2F meetings with all possible correspondents is something which exists\nwith conventional ciphers.  The cost of key storage is trivial: a fraction\nof the cost of the yearly (or less frequent) travel to meet each\ncorrespondent in person.  Consider replaceable hard drive cartridges (30 meg\nfor about a buck a meg), digital cassette formats including applications\ninvolving videocassettes, and so on.  Yes, as you say, you have to exchange\nkeys each time you run out of key; but you can keep ten years' with of key\n(error: \"worth\" not \"with\") on hand if you like, taking up less physical\nspace than a box of cookies.  \n\n\"Bandwidth required is much higher...\"  In what way?  Certainly not in terms\nof transmission; a stream cipher is a stream cipher.  Perhaps in that each\nplaintext character requires one key character?  This is just another\nformulation of the \"storage\" issue: and again, if you have a stack of 30MB\ncartridges, who cares?  Not like we're talking about punched paper tape.\n\nI do agree that PKS offer convenience and features not available with\nconventional ciphers.  However, RSA is just one mathematical breakthrough\naway from being obsolete, and we have no way of knowing when that\nbreakthrough occurs.  It may also be that massively parallel processors can\nbe built through VLSI technology, allowing the cost of brute force solutions\nto come down to a reasonable level.  \n\nAll of this is not by way of getting down on PKS.  I would suggest that we\nneed a number of different systems, and need to keep them all in fairly\nconstant use.  I think we're already all in agreement that one of those\nsystems should be RSA-based.  Now I'm just suggesting that a One-Time system\nshould be another one among the many.\n\nBTW, sorry I couldn't make today's meeting; various local tasks demanding\nattention; plus physical travel distance.

It could be an on-line service\nsuch as GENIE or Compu$erve.\n\nLocal equipment is the terminal, or Pc or Mac or whatever, that you \nuse to connect to the host.  It could also be the laptop that you\nconnect to a cellular modem and connect to the host while mobile.\n\nYou could always use the same local equipment.  Or you may use different\ntypes at different times (a terminal at work, a PC connected through\na modem from home, a firend's Mac, a borrowed laptop using a\ncellular modem, etc).\n\nThe connection could be direct, as in the case of a terminal or\na direct dial-up by modem.\n\nOr the connection could go through multiple channels.  For example\nyou could dial up a TYMNET POP, and then connect to your host.

Faster and more complete tax collection, with the tax authorities\nand implicit partner in all economic transactions (save for black\nmarkets, but I'll discuss that later).\n\nThe \"faster\" part will be a one-shot gain, just as the witholding tax\nsystem instituted in WWII as an emergency program was a one-shot\nbenefit. But such an immediate gain may be quite attractive to\nplanners faced with rapidly escalating national debt. ($4.5 trillion,\nincreasing by at least $400 billion a year...more if the \"IOUs\" for\nsocial security are considered)\n\nThe \"more complete\" part will be an attempt to recapture taxes now\nlost to the underground, or barter, economy. \"Serious\" black\nmarketeers, or dealers in illegal substances, will of course not be\ngreatly affected, but a shift to purely electronic money will hurt\ntheir ability to move money (unless they control the banks and S&Ls,\nas may be the case....but that's another story).\n\n2. A general closing of the underground economy, separate from the\nissue of recapturing lost tax revenues. As the underground economy\nincreases, especially to the levels seen in other countries, pressures\nto \"close the loopholes\" (= cash) may mount. The failing \"War on\nDrugs\" has already been used to justify many serious abridgements of\nbasic rights; applying the same logic to creating a cashless society\nseems to be the next step.\n\n3. \"Welfare reform\" by restricting the allowable expenditures that can\nbe made. For example, a welfare, food stamp, or AFDC recipient could\nbe barred from buying liquor with his or her \"money.\" Electronic money\nneed not be \"fungible,\" in the sense that all forms are\ninterchangeable--it is fairly easy to attach various restrictions to\nthe electronic databases which hold the money.\n\nSuch restrictions would meet with a lot of popular support, and so\ncould undercut the protests a bit. (Support may also come from the\n\"national identity card\" aspects, as such a card would help to solve\nthe problem of illegal immigrants and those who move to jurisdictions\nwith better welfare benefits. I'm not _approving_ of this, merely\npointing out a source of support for \"welfare cards.\")\n\n(Bypasses can still be done, as with food stamps which are sold in\nexchange for booze. Ironically, the flourishing black market in food\nstamps is a motivation for going to an \"electronic welfare card,\"\nwhich is being talked about and which is an obvious precursor step to\nthe eventual ban on paper money cash.)\n\n4. Fears of the growing ease of counterfeiting may push this shift\nalong. Color copiers are now so good that nearly undetectable\ncounterfeiting of U.S. currency is straightforward. Attempts to embed\nconductive threads, holograms, etc., are helping, but the longterm\nfuture is not bright for physical money (excluding gold, which has its\nown problems that I won't discuss here).\n\n(Note that foreign printing presses can quite easily produce excellent\ncounterfeit currency, for use in destabilizing foreign regimes, in\neconomic warfare, etc. Apparently the U.S. has supported the flooding\nof Iraq with counterfeit currency. And Iraq has supposedly printed\nvast amounts of counterfeit U.S. and European currency. Digital money,\ncryptographically protected, is about the only protection against this\nthreat.)\n\n5. If the government controls and sets the protocols for electronic\nmoney, this gives them de facto control over encryption systems and\nprotocols.  Use of non-approved protocols may be considered ipso facto\nproof of money laundering, black marketeering, and tax evasion.\n\nThe Dennning/Rivest key registration proposal appears to be some\nadvance planning for creating a system in which the government is\neffectively a third party in all communications (= transactions). \n\nI suggest we look at all such key registration proposals in this light.\n\n6. More speculatively, the elimination of cash may be used to prop up\nU.S. banks, which many feel are facing a rocky future. By making the\nbanks the \"mediators\" of such a government-mandated electronic money\nsystem, this both \"privatizes\" the system and provides a new revenue\nstream for these powerful lobbying interests. For example, your local\nbank may issue the debit card and may take, say, 0.5% of every\ntransaction. The government might then take, say, 3% of every\ntransaction as its \"cut.\" (The actual details are likely to be\nhideously complex, along the lines of the V.A.T. taxes of Europe, and\nso this example should only be taken as a rough example of what could\nhappen.)\n\n\nNow it has long been clear to me that the future of money lies in\nelectronic form, cryptographically protected. The prolific use of\ncredit cards for mail-order purchases points to the need for a purely\nelectronic form of usable money, as do systems like AMIX (which uses\nVISA-type credits and debits). The issue is who creates this system,\nand what controls exist.\n\nIt seems unlikely that the U.S. government will allow \"competing\ncurrencies\" (one form of digital money, and arguably what we already\nhave with various tradable financial instruments, which rise and fall\nin value depending on various forces) to spring into being, at least\nnot in forms that are truly like cash.\n\nHowever, if the government creates this cashless society, then the government\nwill have unprecedented control over nearly all aspects of our lives.\nAll transactions, no matter how trivial, will be recorded, stored, and\nsubject to analysis. A complete audit trail of all purchases, food\npreferences, entertainment choices, liasons with others, etc., will\nexist. This is the concern David Chaum has eloquently raised, and\nwhich he has been dealing with (partially) with his digital money and\nuntraceable transactions systems.\n\nFurthermore, transactions which are deemed to be politically\nincorrect, and there are dozens of obvious examples to choose from,\ncan be _outlawed_ by the mere typing of a few lines of instructions into\nthe appropriate data bases. (For example, someone arrested for DUI\ntries to buy some beer...\"Your transaction cannot be completed. Have a\nnice day.\"  appears on the cash register. Or a pregnant woman--and\nunder Clinton's computerized health care system this will all be\nknown--tries to buy some cigarettes....)\n\nReread John Brunner's amazingly prescient \"Shockwave Rider\" for some\nvisions of a fully-computerized society.\n\nThis trend toward a cashless society, controlled by the government,\nrepresents the greatest threat to our libery and our future I can\nimagine.\n\nWe need to start planning to head this off. Those interested in\n\"crypto anarchy\" as one technological solution are encourage to get in\ntouch with me.\n\n(I now have MacPGP, which makes things slightly easier than before,\nbut it's still a pain to download files and decrypt them. The\nanonymous remailer services discussed on the \"Cypherpunks\" list should\nhelp as well.)\n\nMake no mistake, a government-run cashless society will be worse that\nOrwell's worst.\n\n--Tim May\n\n\n-- \n..........................................................................\nTimothy C.

He offered to do some Xeroxing if people would\n\"pay\" him.\n\nThere are lots of proposals for electronic cash in the literature,\nmostly very complex.  I think one of Chaum's simpler proposals would be\nadequate for email \"banking\".  This proposal, from the beginning of\nhis paper \"Untraceable Electronic Cash\" in Crypto 88(?), goes like\nthis:\n\n1. Alice chooses a random x and r, and supplies the bank with\nB=r^3*f(x) mod n, where f is a one-way function (like MD5), and n is\nthe modulus for the bank's public key.\n\n2. The bank takes the third root of B (e.g. via an RSA decryption) and\nsends it back to Alice: D = r * f(x)^(1/3), and withdraws one dollar from\nher account.\n\n3. Alice extracts C = f(x)^(1/3) by dividing D by r.  (Note that\ndivision can be done mod n without knowing the factors of n, but it's\nrather complicated.)\n\n4. To pay Bob one dollar, Alice gives him (x, C).\n\n5. Bob can verify that C = f(x)^(1/3), but he still has to send (x, C)\nto the bank in order to make sure that x hasn't been used before.\nOtherwise Alice could spend (x, C) twice.  The bank increases Bob's\naccount by one dollar.\n\nThis scheme is pretty simple and provides untraceability - the bank\nsaw B and D but not C, so although it can verify that (x, C) is legit,\nit can't correlate that with Alice's withdrawal.\n\nThe main disadvantage of this approach is that Bob has to send (x, C)\nto the bank right away (or at least before sending Alice anything in\nreturn for her cash) to verify that the cash hasn't been used before.\nBut in email, where turnarounds of a day or more aren't unusual, this\nshould be tolerable.\n\nAlice and Bob could be pseudonyms, using anonymous addresses to\ncommunicate with each other and with the bank.\n\nDifferent denominations of cash could correspond to different\nexponents than \"3\" in the example above.  (That is, $1 would use\nC=f(x)^(1/3), $2 would use C=f(x)^(1/5), $4 would use C=f(x)^(1/7),\nand so on.)\n\nTechnically, this would be quite easy to implement, using the code in\nPGP for the arithmetic, and MD5 for the one-way function.  We'd need\nto define a few message formats.  The RFC1113 ascii encoding from PGP\ncould be used as well.\n\nThe \"social\" problems are more challenging, it seems to me.  What is\nthe backing for this electronic money?  Why do people care what their\nbank balances are?  Is this stuff really worth anything?\n\nOne possibility is to base digital cash on real money.  People would\nopen a pseudonymous account via email, then postal-mail dollars to the\nbank, enclosing their account number so the bank would know whom to\ncredit with the deposit.  Later, if someone wanted to withdraw \"real\nmoney\" from their account they would have to give a real postal\naddress where it could be mailed.  Now the electronic money is worth\nreal dollars.  Even if people didn't deposit or withdraw very often,\nit still has value because of the backing.\n\nUnfortunately, this approach would currently be illegal (at least,\nunless you actually were a real bank!).  If there were some way the\nbank itself could be anonymous, it might survive, but I don't see how\nto mail it money while keeping the anonymity.  Still, we could\nconsider experimenting with this on a small scale with accounts of no\nmore than a few dollars.  As long as it was clearly an experiment I\ndoubt that any prosecutions would result even if it attracted\ngovernment attention, because the expense involved in court costs\nwould be so disproportionate to the few dollars involved in this\ntechnically illegal act.\n\nAnother approach would be not to try backing the digital cash at all,\nor rather backing it implicitly by the determination of various people\nto accept it and perform services or supply goods in return for it.\nTim's offer to Xerox papers in return for digital cash would be one\nexample.  Perhaps others could provide some other services.  It would\nbe great if some shareware author would accept digital cash as a\nsymbol of support for crypto anonymity.\n\nOne problem that I see with this approach is how you determine the\nsize of the money supply.  Or, in other words, how does new digital\ncash get started circulating?  How do people get new accounts, and how\nmuch money is in them?\n\nIf these problems can be solved, a big advantage of this approach is\nthat the banker can be anonymous.  He would be known only by his\nanonymous address and his public key(s).  This would provide some\nsafety in the event that even a small-scale experiment like this\nwas targetted for a crackdown.\n\nAnother issue is the prospect of multiple \"banks\", each issuing their\nown (incompatible) cash.  How would they compete?  Perhaps in terms of\nrapid turnaround?  Some might choose to be anonymous, others would go\npublic.  The latter would have the advantage that people might trust\nthem more, but OTOH there is more chance of your bank account\ndisappearing after a crackdown for a public bank than an anonymous\none.\n\nLots to think about here!\n\nHal\n74076.1041@compuserve.com", "body_length": 5037, "has_pgp": false, "flags": [], "parent_id": null, "children_ids": ["9211252219.AA00550@netcom.netcom.com", "9211301618.AA14930@soda.berkeley.edu", "782@morgan.demon.co.uk", "199211261116.AA24529@well.sf.ca.us", "9211261718.AA28906@askinc.ask.COM", "9211260023.AA11537@coombs.anu.edu.au", "9211280427.AA21844@rchilder.us.oracle.com", "893@morgan.demon.co.uk", "9211290407.AA00714@rchilder.us.oracle.com", "199211290850.AA03386@well.sf.ca.us", "9211301830.AA23870@nano.noname", "9301240115.AA11642@nano.noname"], "is_thread_root": true, "orphan_status": "true_root", "normalized_subject": "electronic banking", "thread_id": "thread_3a7ae2b65066c758"}, {"id": "b701e83670a4d284", "year": 1992, "source_file": "cyp-1992.txt", "line_number": 34279, "from_raw": "donb@netcom.com (Don Bellenger)", "from_name": "Don Bellenger", "from_email": "donb@netcom.com", "date_raw": "Fri, 27 Nov 92 08:30:05 PST", "date_parsed": "1992-11-27T08:30:05-08:00", "subject": "Cypher Bank", "message_id": "9211271625.AA08403@netcom2.netcom.com", "in_reply_to": null, "references": [], "to": "cypherpunks@toad.com", "cc": "", "content_type": "text/plain", "body": "Does anyone know of a law, rule, regulation, or other restriction \nthat would prohibit the establishment of a simple cypher based bank?\n\nI can think of 3 basic areas that would have to be satisfied:\n\n     1.

May\ntcmay@netcom.com\n\n\nA specter is haunting the modern world, the specter of crypto \nanarchy. \n\nComputer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for \nindividuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other \nin a totally anonymous manner. Two persons may exchange \nmessages, conduct business, and negotiate electronic contracts \nwithout ever knowing the True Name, or legal identity, of the other. \nInteractions over networks will be untraceable, via extensive re-\nrouting of encrypted packets and tamper-proof boxes which \nimplement cryptographic protocols with nearly perfect assurance \nagainst any tampering. Reputations will be of central importance, far \nmore important in dealings than even the credit ratings of today. \nThese developments will alter completely the nature of government \nregulation, the ability to tax and control economic interactions, the \nability to keep information secret, and will even alter the nature of \ntrust and reputation.\n\nThe technology for this revolution--and it surely will be both a social \nand economic revolution--has existed in theory for the past decade. \nThe methods are based upon public-key encryption, zero-knowledge \ninteractive proof systems, and various software protocols for \ninteraction, authentication, and verification. The focus has until now \nbeen on academic conferences in Europe and the U.S., conferences \nmonitored closely by the National Security Agency. But only recently \nhave computer networks and  personal computers attained sufficient \nspeed to make the ideas practically realizable. And the next ten \nyears will bring enough additional speed to make the ideas \neconomically feasible and essentially unstoppable. High-speed \nnetworks, ISDN, tamper-proof boxes, smart cards, satellites,  Ku-band \ntransmitters, multi-MIPS personal computers, and encryption chips \nnow under development will be some of the enabling technologies. \n\nThe State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of this \ntechnology, citing national security concerns, use of the technology \nby drug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration. \nMany of these concerns will be valid; crypto anarchy will allow \nnational secrets to be trade freely and will allow illicit and stolen \nmaterials to be traded. An anonymous computerized market will \neven make possible abhorrent markets for assassinations and \nextortion. Various criminal and foreign elements will be active users \nof CryptoNet. But this will not halt the spread of crypto anarchy.\n\nJust as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of \nmedieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will \ncryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations \nand of government interference in economic transactions. Combined \nwith emerging information markets, crypto anarchy will create a \nliquid market for any and all material which can be put into words \nand pictures. And just as a seemingly minor invention like barbed \nwire made possible the fencing-off of vast ranches and farms, thus \naltering forever the concepts of land and property rights in the \nfrontier West, so too will the seemingly minor discovery out of an \narcane branch of mathematics come to be the wire clippers which \ndismantle the barbed wire around intellectual property.\n\nArise, you have nothing to lose but your barbed wire fences!\n\n\n-- \n..........................................................................\nTimothy C.

But the way we can tell that the key matches the physical person\nwho we met, is to have it signed by someone we trust.  The signature\nindicates that \"I certify that this key really does belong to the physical\nperson identified in the name field\".  Don't sign someone's key unless\nyou are sure you can make that statement (like, they're standing in the\nsame room with you and they verify that they key ID matches their real key).\nDon't sign a key that you received by email or over a modem; it might\nbe from someone impersonating your friend (when they left their keyboard\nunattended for a few minutes).\n\nPGP works on the model that you specify, for each person on your key\nring, how much you trust them to introduce you to other people.  For\nexample, I trust Tom Jennings \"most of the time\", and I got Tom's key\nfrom him personally.  So I know that if Tom's signature appears on\nsomeone's key, it probably really is that person.  I've instructed PGP\nto know this, too.  I also trust Phil Karn as an introducer, and got\nhis key from him personally.  PGP knows that if both Phil and Tom have\nsigned someone's key, that I can believe it *really* is that person.\n\nThe people you trust will be the people *you* trust; don't rely on trusting\nsomeone else's friends.  We are trying to set up an interlocking web of\ntrusted friends so that even if you don't know me, you will know and trust\ntwo other people who know me, and can thereby know my key is good.\n\nMaking a key distribution system that works on a web of trust is\nresearch.  It's never been done before.  We'd like to give it a good\ntry, among highly motivated people, to understand how it works and how\nto improve it.  The alternative we're faced with (e.g. in PEM) is\nhierarchical systems in which some authority figure signs your key --\nwith all the attendant possibilities for misuse of power.

But in such applications a\nhigh level of data security is indispensable,\" he said.  \"Likewise\nthe need for secure access codes is a primary consideration for\ncustomer-card use in the Pay TV and cellular phone markets.\"\n\nThe on-chip arithmetic unit running in parallel with the CPU can complete\na 512-byte calculation in less than 1.5 seconds versus more than a\nminute to do the calculation in software.  This high-speed performance\nmakes it feasible to use highly secure and complex public-key\ncryptography algorithms in everyday transactions.\n\nAsymmetric, public-key cryptography uses one key to encrypt and another\nto decrypt so that only one of the keys need be kept secret.  The other\ncan be freely distributed.  The method is thus highly applicable to\ncommercial transactions.\n\nThe 83C852 microcontroller is based on the industry-standard 8-bit\n80C51 processor core and uses the same instruction set.  The circuit\nincorporates 6 Kbytes of ROM and 256 bytes of RAM in addition to the\n2 Kbytes of EEPROM.\n\nThe EEPROM provides automatic hardware error correction for single-bit\nerrors in any of the stored data bytes.  After customer software is loaded,\nelectronic fuses in the array can be blown to limit access to processor\nfetch commands.  The address bus is mixed to provide further protection\nagainst fraudulent access and optical scanning, and a low-frequency\ndetection circuit can guard against external tampering.\n\nThe new processor operates from a single 5-volt supply at clock\nfrequencies up to 6 MHz (1 microsecond instruction cycle).  All voltages\nrequired during programming or erasure of the EEPROM are generated on chip.\nNonvolatile data retention is for ten years and the circuit offers an\ninfinite number of read cycles.  The microcontroller includes a power-on/off\nreset circuit, and idle and power-down modes.\n\nThe microcontrollers can be ordered as a wafer, die on foil or in SO-28\nsmall-outline packages.  The SO package is available for smart-card\nreaders and can function as an embedded security module in systems such\nas restricted access computers.\n\nWafer and die-on-foil versions of the 83C852 smart card microcontroller\nare available now at a unit price of $5.10 and $5.20 respectively in\n10,000 quantites.  Units in SO-28 packages will be available in\nfirst quarter 1993 priced at $6.85 in the same quantities.\n\nCONTACT:  Thomas Brenner (408) 991-3552\n\nHe's with Philips-Signetics.  I have no affiliation with them, so don't\ncontact me about this part.  If you call Tom, be sure to tell him you\nheard about the chip from MARK THORSON on USENET.  If enough people\ndo this, maybe they'll give me a free development system.  (On the\nother hand maybe they'll tell me \"Please don't post any more of our\npress releases on Usenet.\" :-)\n\n--\n..........................................................................\nTimothy C.

If you're making one time\npads, you need high bit rates, but otherwise you don't.  10Kbps is\novercapacity for personal use.\n\nLet's do an estimate.  Suppose all you use your random numbers for is\nto create session keys for socket connections.  Now lets say you need\nto open a socket about once a minute.  Since you need, say, 500 bits\nfor a DH key exchange, that's a bit rate of about 10 bits per second.\n\nOne can cache bits coming in from the random number generator in a\nring buffer.  You can make this ring buffer arbitarily large, or even\nvirtualize it to disk and make it appear as infinite in size.  Then\nyou could run your generator continuously and always have enough bits\navailable for use.\n\nIf you're using a generator for making session keys, then you just\ndon't need that high a bandwidth.  \n\nNow the $/bps for the Newbridge chip is much lower, but for personal\nuse you throw away too many of its bits to make it worthwhile.

One year it\nwas hypertext (and Xanadu got started when John Walker of Autodesk met\nTed Nelson, Mark Miller, Roger Gregory, and others at Hackers in\n1987), another year it was multimedia. Last year it was effectively\nthe EFF, and so on. My hunch is that this year the de facto theme\n_could_ turn out to be crypto tools and digital protection of privacy.\n\nIn addition to our session, there will be discussions of wireless\ncommunication, the work of the EFF, and a Sunday discussion of these\ncritical issues. These will all fit nicely with our own session.\n\nOur session is in \"prime time,\" mid-Saturday afternoon, tentatively\n(you all know how schedules change!), and is one of the \"no\ncompetitors\" tracks, so attendance should be very high. Accordingly,\nsome premium should be placed on organization, to maximize the\ninformation flow. Too many people for the \"circle discussion\" that\nworked so well at last year's nanotechnology session (run by Ted\nKaehler), so we need to figure out a good format.\n\nSo give me your inputs!

I'll let you know in the\nnext several days what we decide, and where we'll meet.)\n\n\n* What topics need to be discussed the most? \n\n* What format? Panel discussion? A series of mini-lectures on the\nvarious topics? Free-for-all discussion? (Remember that we'll probably\nbe in a big room, with perhaps as many as 100-150 attendees.)\n\n* Some ideas for topics (which I'll add to as people make\nsuggestions):\n\n- A very brief review of modern cryptology (very brief because we need\nto move on quickly to the juicy stuff), including snapshot summaries\nof encryption, RSA (but no number theory!), anonymous mail, digital\ncash, etc. (Too many crypto panels spend the entire time bringing\npeople up to speed on what prime numbers are, on how one-time pads are\nused, and so on.

I believe that all the parti-\n: cipants in this discussion would agree that: When the Government\n: can show, through legitimately obtained evidence, that a particular\n: encrypted communication relates to a crime, then they can, after\n: the fact, subpoena the plaintext of that communication.  What\n: most of us object to is having to yield the keys before the fact.\n\nAgreed. The current procedure for subpoenaing documents works fairly\nwell.\n\nBut Prof. Denning's comments clearly indicate the concern is with\ncatching terrorists, kidnappers, subversives, and other such types _in\nthe planning stage_. That is, wiretapping and surveillance.\n\nAnd I'll got out on a limb, too. My suspicion, and that of many\nothers, is that the case of the FBI catching terrorists before the act\nin the U.S. (and there's a well-known case of a Japanese Red Army\nterrorist caught in the Midwest several years ago) reveals the sources\nthe FBI uses. The NSA is the likely source. Only the NSA listening in\non millions of telephone conversations (not banned by any law...the\nlaws you hear about on wiretapping and surveillance mostly deal with\nthe FBI, law enforcement, and, supposedly, the CIA. The NSA is almost\ncompletely exempt from such laws.).\n\nIf you haven't yet read James Bamford's \"The Puzzle Palace,\" run out\nand get a copy and read it. You'll see why former DIRNSA General Odom\ncalled Bamford \"an unindicted felon.\" (Why in the eyes of the National\nSecurity Establishment, that is.)\n\nSIGINT OPERATION MINARET, begun in 1969 when Nixon declared the \"War\non Drugs,\" brought the NSA together with the FBI, CIA, BNDD (Bureau of\nNarcotics and Dangerous Drugs, precursor to DEA) to launch a series of\nnew surveillance programs. In May 1970 the NSA extended routine\nsurveillance to _pay phones_ in suspect areas (sound familiar, with\nthe Digital Telephony Bill?). The release of the Pentagon Papers in\n1971 revealed the extent of FBI and NSA elsur (electronic\nsurveillance) on U.S. citizens.\n\nOPERATION SHAMROCK goes back even further. Beginning in 1945, the FBI\nand NSA (its precursors, actually, such as Army Signal Corps, etc.)\ncooperated to monitor dissidents, radicals, authors, etc. It was not\nuntil October 1973 that about-to-be-fired Attorney General Elliot\nRichardson (now fighting for INSLAW in a very similar case, which\nProf. Denning ought to read about) ordered the FBI and the CIA's\n\"Security Service\" (aptly named SS) to stop requesting NSA\nsurveillance material. In 1977 the Justice Department recommended\nagainst prosecution of the FBI and NSA employees engaged in Shamrock\nand Minaret.\n\nFew Americans understand how pervasive is the NSA's listening system.\nCOINTELPRO, Huston Plan, RCA Global (provided copied of all telegrams\nfor 40 years!), FINCEN, and so many other keywords! Huge antennas in\nWest Virginia, in Idaho, and elsewhere (mostly located near major\nsatellite downlinks). Read Bamford's book. Then be afraid....be _very_\nafraid.\n\nUnderstand that there are virtually no laws governing the NSA's\nsurveillance of fax machines, modems, the Internet (including all of\nthese postings, obviously), voice phones, telex and TWX, and on and\non. Because of the \"national security\" role, wide lattitude is given. \n\nNo doubt some criminal plans are uncovered. The NSA detected, it has\nbeen admitted, the planned bombing of the Berlin discotheque that led to\nthe '86 raid on Libya. (However, the bombing still occurred...draw your\nown conclusions.) But is it worth the price?\n\nNow there is talk of using the NSA's formidable listening abilities\nfor economic espionage against our economic opponents! \n\nIs it any wonder the NSA is scared sh..less over the spread of secure\nand untappable communications systems?\n\nBe afraid, be _very_ afraid.\n-- \n..........................................................................\nTimothy C.

They can be used to\nimplement Chaum's DC-nets.  For the degenerate case of just two people\ncommunicating, the DC-net is similar to using a one-time pad.\nHowever, what you are hiding is not _what_ you are sending, but _who_\nis sending it.\n\nDC-nets (\"DC\" stands for \"Dining Cryptographers\", the example Chaum\nused to introduce the idea) are designed to hide message sources among\nsome group of people.  The people have to be fairly well connected,\nwith near-real-time communications capability.  It won't really work\nfor people exchanging email.\n\nFor the simple two-person case, suppose as in the case of the one-time\npad that each person has an identical CD-ROM filled with random bits.\nWhat they do is, at some predetermined rate, each person just\ntransmits the bits off his pad.  Both people are sending the same\nbits.\n\nWhen one wants to send a message, he starts toggling certain of his\nbits.  To send a \"1\" he sends the opposite of the next bit from the\none-time pad; to send a zero he sends the correct version of the next\nbit from the one-time pad.\n\nAssuming they don't start transmitting at the same time, what an\noutside observer will see is that, where before they were both\nproducing exactly the same bits, now they are producing a certain\nnumber of opposite bits.  Interpreting each opposite bit as a 1, and\neach case of same bits as a 0, produces a recognizable message.\n\nBut, the outside observer can't tell which person is sending that\nmessage.  All he sees is two totally random streams of bits, which\ndisagree at certain spots.  Without access to the one-time pads, there\nis no way for him to tell who is sending.  (Of course, the two people\ninvolved know who is sending, since one of them is and one of them\nisn't.)\n\nGeneralizing to larger numbers of people, you need to have a separate\none-time pad shared with each other person in the group.  In other\nwords, for a group of N people there has to be a total of N(N-1)/2\none-time pads; each person has N-1 of them.  That is, for each pair of\npeople in the group, there is a unique and secret one-time pad which\nthey share.  (This is for maximal security - you can get by with fewer\npads if you trust each other some.)\n\nNow, they all send all the time.  What they send is the \"XOR\" of the\nnext bits of all their N-1 one-time pads.  It turns out that if you\nthen \"XOR\" everybody's output bits, you'll get nothing but zeros as a\nresult.  When someone wants to send, he sends the opposite of what he\nnormally would for a \"1\", and he sends just what he normally would for\na \"0\".  Collisions can be handled like ethernet - back off and\nretransmit.  (Chaum had another way involving reserving future blocks\nof transmit time.)\n\nWith N people sharing N-1 one-time pads per person, nobody can tell\nwho is transmitting.  All anyone knows is whether he himself is\ntransmitting or not; all an outside observer knows is that someone in\nthe group is transmitting.\n\nDC-Nets eat up one-time pads even worse than using them for message\nsecrecy does.  But, with CD's, you can put a lot of data on a pad.\nAnd the system is fairly robust against pads being stolen.  If one\nperson's one-time pads are all secretly copied by a spy, then he can\ntell if that person is sending.  But he learns absolutely nothing\nabout which other people are sending.\n\nI wonder if it would be possible to experiment with a DC-Net system in\nthe Internet environment.  I recently acquired an account on a system\nwith Internet connectivity (I know because I can telnet and ftp from\nit).  I've done considerable programming with Unix socket\ncommunication in systems connected by ethernet, and I think the\nInternet provides a very similar programming interface.  It shouldn't\nbe that hard to create a very simple \"chat\" program in which message\nsources are strictly anonymous (assuming the existance of the required\none-time pad random-number files - for testing, they could be created\nby random number generators at each end, started with identical seeds).\nI'll try some experiments along these lines over the next few days.\n\nHal\n74076.1041@compuserve.com", "body_length": 4185, "has_pgp": false, "flags": [], "parent_id": null, "children_ids": ["9210280620.AA04910@netcom2.netcom.com"], "is_thread_root": true, "orphan_status": "true_root", "normalized_subject": "one-time pads and dc nets", "thread_id": "thread_65154b39b1102552"}, {"id": "f1ac727de3bb43e0", "year": 1992, "source_file": "cyp-1992.txt", "line_number": 2520, "from_raw": "Eric Hughes <hughes@soda.berkeley.edu>", "from_name": "Eric Hughes", "from_email": "hughes@soda.berkeley.edu", "date_raw": "Sun, 4 Oct 92 19:51:17 PDT", "date_parsed": "1992-10-04T19:51:17-07:00", "subject": "introducers", "message_id": "9210050258.AA22363@soda.berkeley.edu", "in_reply_to": "9210040546.AA10254@atdt.org", "references": [], "to": "cypherpunks@toad.com", "cc": "", "content_type": "text/plain", "body": ">If I send you my public key -- even if I cc: dockmaster -- what does\n>it matter that the NSA knows my public key (unoless they want to send\n>me msgs, too)?

Now if I might try to salvage my position...\n\n\"One time pads are very (much more) expensive on a per-link basis than\npublic key systems...\"  \n\nYes, of course.  However I don't envision OTPs as a standard for bulk\nencryption on large networks.  Rather, for person-to-person communication in\nsmall networks.  Examples: a group of civil rights attorneys suing the\nFederal govt., an international environmental organisation's main offices in\nthe capital cities of a small number of countries, etc.  Cases where the\nadversary is one or more powerful governments, and the number of links\nrequired is relatively small.  Given the nature of the relationships between\nthese kinds of networks and their adversaries, the expense would seem to be\njustified; in any case, the **incremental** cost of for instance a set of\n30MB cartridges as compared to a few floppy discs, is an minor fraction of\nthe cost of the airline tickets and other expenses for trusted couriers.\n(oops: \"a minor fraction...\")\n\nYour discussion of bandwidth can be met with a similar counter-arguement.\nFirst of all, I would reject the use of UPS or (God help us) the *Post\nOffice* as a courier, particularly where one or more governments may be the\nadversaries against whom protection is needed.  \nSo your reference to those carriers is not relevant to the main point of my\ncase.  I'm assuming that key materials are transported by trusted courier\nand are guarded by same until they reach their intended recipient.  Okay,\nthat *really* drives up the cost, doesn't it...?  Not if the key materials\n\"hitch hike\" on an existing travel plan: attorney A flies out to city B to\nvisit attorney B... and happens to carry key material onboard in his/her\nshoulder bag.  No added cost except for the storage devices, and that is not\nsignificant.  \n\nRe mathematical breakthroughs in factoring etc, you say, \"we don't know when\nthat will happen, and we don't know which will happen.\"  Exactly my point.\n*We* don't know.  But the NSA and so on, most certainly do know, and they\nwon't be telling.  If the breakthrough comes, then the period between that\npoint and the point when it is publicised, will be one of false security.\nWas it Kahn who said nothing is more dangerous than a bad cipher?  My point\nhere comes down to nothing more or less than the principle of caution in the\nface of an unknown.  \n\n(Discussion of relative cost of brute force solutions, and the question of\nhard problems and scale.)  I agree that my intuition about these things may\nbe highly flawed. However this doesn't invalidate my point about the\npossibility of basic breakthroughs happening behind closed doors.  Now in a\nway I'll admit that my arguement here sort of comes down to a black box.\nHowever, again I would assert that there are cases where the almost\nirrational caution is worthwhile.  \n\nYou say in concluding, \"Perfect security is not worth the cost in time,\neffort, or dollars when the marginal cost of perfection is less (do you mean\nmore?) than perfection.\"  You cite examples of international banking\nsystems.\n\nI would cite examples of political movements which have been sabotaged and\ndestroyed by government covert action.  One need not look far to run into\nCOINTELPRO and the more recent French govt action of blowing up a Greenpeace\nvessel.  Where your adversaries are the intelligence agencies of world\npowers, and where lives are at stake, I would say the cost of perfect\nsecurity is justified.

We\ndon't know whether factoring is \"fundamentally hard.\" (Project your\nown definition here.)  We should not assume that when the breakthrough\ncomes, that is will be found \"easy.\"  It may be that factoring is\nhard, and that RSA is secure for that reason.  (The astute reader will\nsee that these two are not exactly the same question.)  My current\nthinking is that factoring is hard because of various randomness\nproperties of primes, that in fact multiplying one large prime by\nanother is like encrypting one prime with the other as a one-time pad!\nBut I'm no number theorist.\n\nI do, however, agree with \"caution in the face of an unknown.\"  And\nfor high stakes, George's \"irrational caution\" is not irrational at\nall.\n\nRe: Relative security.

Some have cited discussion of\nmilitary cipher systems as being too dangerous for us to discuss,\nwhile others have expressed some discomfort at the \"anarchist\" flavor\nof some postings.\n\nWell, folks, we all have different axes to grind. Since this is an\nopen, unmoderated list, little control of content can be expected.\n\n* Some want \"cryptography\" downplayed, to be replaced with \"privacy\"\nas an emphasis. Privacy is seen as more palatable to Americans, less\nlikely to upset them into cracking down on crypto methods. In other\nwords, privacy is an easier \"sell\" than secrecy. \n\nPerhaps, but why dilute our focus just to make a more digestable pill\nfor the masses of America, who typically don't think much about\nabstractions anyway? Those who want to sell \"privacy\" are free to.\n(BTW, the die was mostly cast when the name \"Cypherpunks\" was\nadopted. That's already raised red flags, just by the name! If we want\nto downplay this \"crypto-cyber-punks outlaw\" image, then a name change\nto something more like the \"Electronic Frontier Foundation\" or the\nCPSR, nice, safe-sounding names.)\n\n* Others have expressed some concern that some minor details of how\nU.S. cipher machines send out padded traffic were mentioned on this\nlist--the fear being that discussion of military matters will invite\nthe scrutiny of the government. Well, check out sci.military some time\nand see the debate on such issues! Also, many details of the KG-36,\nKWR-37, and Autodin cipher systems--just to cite the specific military\ncipher machines that the posting on this list was probably referring\nto--have already been published, and the Walker spy ring delivered the\ncomplete specs to these and other machines in the early 1980s.\n\nIt's typically only the public who lacks knowledge on these matters.\nThe Soviets (May They Rest in Pieces) usually got the salient details\nfairly quickly.  Since ours is a crypto education group--amongst other\nthings--what's wrong with discussing any of the gadgets and techniques\nthat numerous books and other postings have already dealt with?\n\n(Surely John Gilmore's lawsuit to get some critical crypto papers\ndeclassified has already \"angered\" the folks at NSA. Are we to censure\nJohn for stirring up trouble? Of course not. We're free individuals,\nable to say what we wish, meet in secret meetings without the\npermission of the government, and learn anything we wish to. This, at\nleast, is the theory. Until told otherwise, I intend to act on this\ntheory.)\n\n* Some have argued persuasively for concentrating efforts on the more\npalatable (to the public at large) aspects of crypto techniques, such\nas authentication to reduce forgeries, privacy protection against\nillegal eavesdroppers, and so on. This is the \"selling our vision to\nthe public\" point of view.\n\nFine, it is good for some folks to do this, to concentrate on the\nareas that are unlikely to upset Middle America.\n\nBut some of us--and you've seen my postings--believe the _selling_ of\nthese ideas of authentication and privacy is a lost cause, or at least\nis not our main interest (e.g, it's not _my_ interest).\n\n* I favor technological solutions over political solutions. Don't call\nit sedition, call it the natural trend of new technologies. The\nprinting press broke the power of medieval guilds in ways a political\napproach could never have done. Same with steam engines, electric\nmotors, incandescent light, copying machines, computers,\nmodems...well, you get the point.\n\nThe things we talk about on this list, the things being developed and\ndeployed, will have revolutionary effects. I've written about these\neffects over the past several years, and this wonderful list is\npursuing them all with gusto! The anonymous remailers alone will set\noff alarms throughout the law enforcement community--you're kidding\nyourself if you think otherwise. Are we to stop working on anonymous\nremailers? What about digital cash? \n\nFace it, what we're doing will have major implications. To not talk\nabout these effects, to not speculate on the possible consequences, is\nto bury our heads in the sand for fear that someone reading this list\nwill order this list shut down or have us arrested! \n\nYes, it's true some journalists are reading this list. Yes, it's\nfairly likely someone is forwarding this list to various agencies\n(this isn't paranoia...they'd be fools to not know about this list by\nnow, given the publicity, the reputations of some of us, etc.). I know\nthat some of the recipients of the list are gatewaying to other\nsystems, or are forwarding specific articles to much wider audiences\n(I know this partly from e-mail I get). But these are all consequences\nof having a public list.\n\nAnyone uncomfortable with the free discussion of ideas and\ntechnologies on this list, anyone who fears personal or professional\nliability for views expressed by _others_ on this list, should\nprobably unsubscribe from the list.\n\nI certainly don't intend to stop writing about the areas that interest\nme.\n\nCheers.\n\n--Tim\n\n\n--\n..........................................................................\nTimothy C.

Let me add\na short bit of history here.  MIME came about because of an effort\nwithin the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) to extend Internet\nmail standards to support 8-bit extended character sets and (gasp) to\npotentially even support the sending of arbitrary binary data.  A\nworking group was formed and it took several months and literally\nthousands of messages before some form of consensus was reached on the\ntechnical issues (note -- not the solution, just the issues!).\n\nTo make a long story short, it quickly became obvious that there was\nno agreed upon solution which would both provide the functionality the\nvarious camps wanted, and backwards compatability for the million or\nso hosts currently on the Internet.  The MIME effort was a creative\nstroke of genius which allowed us to get out of this fix.  Simply put,\nit allows for a) arbitrary data types to be encoded into 7-bit ASCII\nand transported using standard RFC-821 SMTP, and b) the structuring of\nchunks of different data type \"parts\" into a single e-mail message\nsuch that MIME-aware mail-agents/readers can intelligently display\nmulti-media mail intelligently.  In other words, the problem was moved\nfrom the protocol space to the applications space.\n\nWhy is this relevant?  Well, in order for MIME to be useful, the mail\nreaders that people use have to be modified to support MIME.\nFortunately, Nathaniel Borenstein of Bellcore has assembled a kit to\nmake this much easier, and in fact provides patches for many mailers.\nNow, the authors of all the freebie mail readers we use are being\nasked to incorporate these changes into their mailers.  Do we really\nwant to give them an additional burden -- or do we want to leverage\noff work that is already being done?\n\n-Ittai\n\nPS:  For those who are interested, these are the relevant RFC's:\n\n1344  Implications of MIME for Internet mail gateways.

We present a recently discovered\nnineteenth-century manuscript about these functions, which in part\nbecause of their applications in cryptology, have received\nconsiderable attention in contemporary computer science research.\nAttributed to the little-known yet highly-suspect\ncomposer/mathematician Maria Poopings, the manuscript can be sung to\nthe tune of ``Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious'' from the musical\nMary Poppins.  In addition, we prove three ridiculous facts about\nsuperpolylogarithmic subexponential functions.  Using novel extensions\nto the popular DTIME notation from complexity theory, we also define\nthe complexity class SuperPolyLog/SubExp, which consists of all\nlanguages that can be accepted within deterministic\nsuperpolylogarithmic subexponential time.  We show that this class is\nnotationally intractable in the sense that it cannot be conveniently\ndescribed using existing terminology.  Surprisingly, there is some\nscientific value in our notational novelties; moreover, students may\nfind this paper helpful in learning about growth rates, asymptotic\nnotations, cryptology, and reversible computation.\n\nKeywords.

There is some trade\npublication devoted entirely to such matters; it's called EMI/RFI\nNews, or Interference Protection News, or something like that.  It's\nfree to qualified subscribers.  The articles are interesting, but\ncannot delve into the really interesting stuff.  But the ads!  Look at\nwhat people are selling, and remember that it is protecting against\nsomething.  Stuff like copper impregnated gasket material, both for\ncomputer cases and for doors (in walls).  Copper braid and cloth.\nConductive glues and caulks.  Special connectors.  Electrical\nisolators.  Fiber optics.\n\n(Aside: If you don't know how to be a qualified subscriber, you're no\nhacker.  Look closely at the subscription card and then figure out\nwhere the publisher of a free magazine gets its money.)\n\nWhat is possible?  CRT monitoring.  A Dutch guy named van Eyck\ndemostrated six years ago or so a CRT monitoring system which he built\nout of spare parts.  It consisted of an TV roof antenna, a non-detent\nUHF tuner (which you can make yourself by removing the detent plate\nfrom an old TV), and a multi-scanning monitor.  No amplification\nbeyond what was in the tuner, no sync stabilization, no special\ndirectional antennas or any other tricks.  He was able to reliably\npick up monitor emissions from 100 meters, if I remember correctly.\nFancier equipment knows what your screen sync rate is, uses bandpass\nfilters, uses better antennas, knows to look for mostly-persistent\nframe information, looks for emissions signatures, and is able to read\none CRT out of a hundred at half a mile.  I suspect this is a low\nestimate of the ability of modern equipment.\n\nHal mentions using flat panel displays to combat emissions.  This\nworks, as evidenced by the continued existence of Grid Computer.\nRemember Grid, who came out with these way-expensive gas plasma\nlaptops around 1985/6?  The reason they sold so many of those and are\nstill around was that a large number of them were Tempest certified.\n(Even larger revenues!)  I understand that the Tempest spec Grids had\na thin layer of gold foil in front of the screen, even so.  Yes, gold\nthin enough to see through.\n\nSignal wire monitoring.  Using twisted pair or coax cable, reduces\ntransmitted energy down to very low levels, improving energy transfer\nand reducing monitorability.  But even with zero radiated energy there\nis still the near field of the wire which can be inductively tapped.\nNo conductive contact is necessary.  If you can put a wire next to my\nphone line somewhere, you can tap my phone.  It's by nature a high\nimpedance tap, requring sensitive ampilifiers but at the same time\ndifficult to find even by a reflectometer.\n\nWithout a twisted pair, the situation is worse.  Keyboards for the PC\nuse a serial protocol at a fixed frequency.  The cables are not\ntwisted pair.  I haven't heard anything about that specifically, but I\npresume that keystrokes can be read extremely easily.\n\nCPU monitoring.  Yes, it's possible.  I've heard that it is possible\nto actually run a CPU in parallel with a monitored one.  In order to\ndo this, you need to correlate signals in real time across a fairly\nwide RF spectrum.  Each CPU pin or I/O bus signal occurs in a\ndifferent physical location inside the case.  The case is active in\nterms of emmission, reflecting signals around like mad.  All these\ndifferent physical locations and reflections give rise to phase\ndifferences and interference patterns.  Once you figure out what the\nsignatures of the various signals are, you can separate them out from\neach other by correlation and deconvolution.  George's concern about\nemissions through phone lines falls into this category.\n\nOther stuff.  I've heard rumors about using microwave pinging to\ndetermine stuff about electrical equipment.  Or about implanting\npassive devices that alter the EM field locally in order to make\nmonitoring easier.  It's safe to presume that there is some amazing\nstuff going on.  Read The Puzzle Palace for more hints.  (Like the\nvalley in WV which is one big antenna.)\n\nEmissions monitoring is also all economics.  The price to monitor\nincreases with each more sophisticated attack.  CRT's are easy, CPU's\nare hard.  I would like to see public research in this area, just like\nthere is public research in cryptography.  Until the public has a\nbetter idea of what various attacks cost, there can't be rational\ndecisions about emissions security.\n\nEric", "body_length": 4616, "has_pgp": false, "flags": [], "parent_id": "9210201452.AA01970@soda.berkeley.edu", "children_ids": ["9210202226.AA28803@netcom2.netcom.com"], "is_thread_root": false, "orphan_status": "has_parent", "normalized_subject": "tempest.", "thread_id": "thread_19a73d6b165b4338"}, {"id": "a99d3abdcd25ca0f", "year": 1992, "source_file": "cyp-1992.txt", "line_number": 9380, "from_raw": "hkhenson@cup.portal.com", "from_name": null, "from_email": "hkhenson@cup.portal.com", "date_raw": "Mon, 19 Oct 92 02:21:17 PDT", "date_parsed": "1992-10-19T02:21:17-07:00", "subject": "one time pads.", "message_id": "9210190136.1.13588@cup.portal.com", "in_reply_to": null, "references": [], "to": "cypherpunks@toad.com", "cc": "", "content_type": "text/plain", "body": "I can suggest a way to \"distribute\" a one time pad, even though the \npeople never meet.

Apparently the only really secure method is a physical transfer\nface-to-face with someone you know; or to have a key certified by\nsomeone you trust whose key you trust. [PGP has key certification\nbuilt-in; for other implementations, just digitally sign some form\nof the key to be certified].\n \nThere is no secure method of exchanging public keys using only the\nnet.  As far as you know all your messages, both incoming and\noutgoing, are being intercepted by a \"spoofer\" who will substitute\nhis public key for yours in all outgoing messages and another public\nkey of his for each unique public key intercepted in incoming mail.\n \nA few methods were discussed on Extropians of trying to get a genuine\npublic key distributed by outsmarting the spoofer. But if the spoofer\nis smarter than you, these methods will fail.\n \nThat leaves methods which exchange, or at least verify, keys by other\nmeans than the network.  I proposed a service to verify keys by paper\nmail and (optionally) telephone.  Here is an update of what I posted.\nThe offer is still good.\n================================================================\nI'd like to announce the opening of the Swank Public Key Verification\nService.\n \nTo become a customer, do the following.\n \n1)On a piece of paper put:\n \n   a)Your name and Network address.\n   b)The \"armored\" ASCii form of your PGP 2.0 Public Key.\n   c)(optional) Any other information you want to certify\n     about yourself, such as:\n      Home address.\n      Mailing address (if different).\n      Home phone number.\n      Occupation-Work Phone-Work Address.\n      \"I am not a law enforcement officer or agent.\"\n   d)\"I certify the above to be true under penalty of perjury\".\n   e)A photocopy of your driver's license or other picture ID\n     with signature.\n     Actually this is a photocopy of all of the above with the\n     ID on top of the original.\n     [note: if you don't want to reveal your home address, you\n     can cover that portion of your photo ID. Your name, photo,\n     and signature must show]\n   f)Your signature. (NOT photocopied)\n   g)(optional). have the paper notarized.\n \n2)E-mail to me\n   edgar@spectrx.saigon.com (Edgar W.

Then what I will do for you:\n \nI will visually verify that the public key on the paper matches\nthe key I received via E-mail and that the signature on your\nphotocopied ID matches your original signature on the paper.\n(I do not claim to be a handwriting expert).\n \nI will send to you by return E-Mail your public key signed with\nmy public key.\n \nI will send to you in the evelope you supplied (or to the address\nyou specify) a paper about myself constructed as described above\n(but not notarized - if you want notarized send an extra $10).\nThis will give you a verification independent of the network\nthat my public key is really mine.\n \nI will post your machine-readable ASCII record that you E-mailed to me\nto Extropians and Cypherpunks (optional, specify if you DON'T want\nthis).  This feature is subject to no objection from Extropians and\nCypherpunks list management.\n \nI will keep your paper on file for at least one year.\n \nAnyone may request a photocopy of your paper (and up to three others)\nby sending me $1 and a self-addressed, stamped envelope.\nI will also send your machine-readable ASCII record to his\nnetwork address, if supplied.\n \nAny customer may also phone me directly at (408)227-3471 during\nreasonable hours and I will verify your/others public key(s) by\nreading them over the phone.\n \nEdgar W.

I will add this as a notation to your electronic and\npaper record.  No extra charge!\n \nAnother possible option is to use a full color photocopy of your photo\nID.  This costs about $1.00 at photocopy centers such as Photo\nDrive-Up as opposed to 5 or 10 cents for an ordinary photocopy.  I\nwill also note this on your electronic and paper record.\n======================================================================\nSo far I have zero (0) customers. Philip Zimmerman, in e-mail to me,\nendorsed the idea, but he has declined to become a customer himself\neven though I waived the fee for him.\n \nPlan B is to exchange/verify public keys face-to-face at parties,\nsuch as the PenSFA parties I previously posted info about. Rather than\nbringing diskettes, I would think printed copies of (armored form)\npublic keys would be easy to handle. I have printed up business-card\nsize copies of *fragments* of my public keys with the 6-hex-digit\n\"Key ID\".  I think it would be very difficult to generate a valid new\nkey pair where the public key matched the key ID and key\nfragment.\n\n--\nedgar@spectrx.saigon.com (Edgar W.

In my earlier incarnation as a physicist for\nIntel, I discovered the alpha particle \"soft error\" effect in memory\nchips. By 1976 chips, especially dynamic RAMs, were storing less than\nhalf a million electrons as the difference between a \"1\" and a \"0\". A\nseveral MeV alpha could generate more than a million electron-hole\npairs, thus flipping some bits.  \n\n(Obviously the effect of alphas on particle detectors was\nknown, and smoke detectors were in wide use, but nobody prior to 1977\nknew that memory bits could be flipped by alphas, coming from uranium\nand thorium in the package materials. It's a long story, so I won't\nsay any more about it here.)\n\n: \t* connect to an IBM PC serial or parallel port\n: \t* be \"dongle\" sized, ie be able to plug directly onto the port, and\n: \t\tnot have a cable from an external box to the port\n: \t* be powered directly from the port\n: \t* generate at least 1000 \"highly random\" bits per second\n\nThis should be feasible by placing a small (sub-microcurie) amount of\nAmericium-241 on a small DRAM chip that is known to be alpha-sensitive\n(and not all of them are, due to processing tricks). Errors would\noccur at random intervals, depending on which bits got hit. Getting\n1000 errors a second would be tough, though, as such high intensities\nwould also tend to eventually destroy the chip (through longterm\ndamage to the silicon, threshold voltage shifts, etc.). If you really\nwant to pursue this seriously, I can help with the calculations, etc.\n\n: Details:\n: \n: Certainly in high volume these things can be made cheaply. Smoke detectors\n: often sell for under $10, and have a radioactive source, an IC, a case, etc.\n\nYes, but smoke detectors use ionization in a chamber (the smoke from a\nfire makes ionization easier). That is, no real ICs. But ICs, and even\nRAM chips, are cheap, so your $10 figure is almost certainly in the ballpark.\n\nA bigger concern is safety, or the _perceived_ safety. Smoke detectors\nhave, I understand, moved away from alpha particle-based detectors to\nphotoelectric detectors (smoke obscures beam of light). Don't\nunderestimate the public's fear of radioactivity, even at low levels.\n\n: Using a well-designed circuit based on Alpha decay should mean that the\n: randomness is pretty darn good.\n\nBut not necessarily any better than noise from a Zener. With the\nhigher bit rate from diode noise, more statistical tricks can be done.\nThe relatively low bit rate from alpha decay gives less flexibility.\nOn the other hand, alpha hits are undeniably quite random, with\nessentially no way to skew the odds  (unlike with diode noise).\n\n: Everyone these days has either a serial or parallel port available, either\n: directly or thru a switch box.\n: \n: The tiny \"dongle\" size is a convenience. If it is small and powered directly\n: from the port, there are no cables to get in the way. There is enough power\n: available from the signal lines on these ports to power simple devices. E.g.\n: most mice don't require an external power supply.\n: \n: For most applications 1000 bits per second should be adequate. For example,\n: it would be quite adequate for session keys. For generating pseudo\n: one-time-pads, an overnight run should generate plenty of values. Continuously\n: generating values for a month would produce about 300 MB, which should be\n: enough to exchange new CD-ROM key disks once a month.\n\nOne time pads are complicated to use. Only very high security\napplications that can also afford them use them. For example, some\ndiplomatic traffic. I can't conceive of a case where 300 MB a month\ncould be used. \n\nAnd _theft_ (or copying) of the CD-ROM one time pads has got to be a\nmuch bigger issue that whether alpha particle noise sources are better\nthan diode noise sources! By about 10 orders of magnitude I would say.\n\nBlack bag jobs on the sites holding the keys will be the likeliest\nattack, not trying to analyze how random the noise is (even a fairly\ncrummy noise source will not yield enough information to a\ncryptanalyst trying to break a one-time pad).\n\nHaving said all this, I'm glad you gave some thought to alphas. For a\ntime in the late 1970s this was the chip industry's number one\nheadache...it was definitely the most exciting time of my life.\n\n--Tim\n-- \n..........................................................................\nTimothy C.

I hope I'll be coherent.\n\n** For production use, you want a real, live bank or other entity to\nissue the \"money\".  Assuming the digital cash is backed by gold, or\nsecurities, or something else tangible, you don't want the bank to go\naway with all your money.  Or, if you read in the newspaper \"Feds\nseize First National Bank\", you want to know if they've just seized\n*your* bank, and therefore will be able to watch your deposits and\nwithdrawals.  If you don't know who your bank really is, you won't\nknow.\n\n** All of the above applies to your escrow agent (who may be your\nbank) for similar reasons.  Public key systems provide\nnon-repudiability, but knowing provably that a pseudonym just stole\nmoney or goods from you doesn't help you get it back.  Sure, it\ntarnishes their reputation, but if they steal a whole lot of money all\nat once, they won't care.\n\n** Anonymity in banking is a well-known concept.  If I transfer money\nfrom my numbered swiss bank account to your numbered swiss bank\naccount, nobody knows anything, except who the bank is.  And I don't\nsee Switzerland giving up their enviable position in the international\nbanking community willingly.  All we need to do is convince a swiss\nbank to do some digital cash banking.  Easier said than done.\n\n** Legality of starting our own anonymous electronic bank: what do the\nlaws say, anyway?  As long as I pay taxes on any profit, I can form a\nsole proprietorship to freely buy and sell purple widgets with very\nlittle government interaction.

The big\n\n-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----\n\nat the start pretty much gives that away.\n\nIn most cases, this is fine, but sometimes it may not be desirable\nto make it this obvious.  Sending encrypted messages may call\nunwelcome attention to yourself.  Also, some people are experimenting\nwith packet radio on the amateur bands, and it's not legal to send\nencrypted messages there.\n\nWhat I think would be nice would be an \"innocent\" mode for PGP\nin which it created files which looked like something else.  For\nexample, what if your encrypted output file looked like:\n\nbegin 666 testpat.gif\nMI\\44:#G4D>QQXR!-M,Z20O1K&5D<U\"C;V<J#-I@:ANT,A+>0, 5-4F.X<%MT\nM2:V94,K;XE@B?]%IHF+_<VT=U! 3Q;;M-K<QT.N\"?%IJTNU!%(KF7K]2^B6+\nM;&TTGTULW(4%:F@\\&MB^ ^Y5Y\\#2A6^*86F-Y\"^%J$>WGI%(]#=F]/[LV+&!\nM,NH0(!3B35CW#!-Z7\"B_L'=-C 8DLB-(J R\"3?EE9<.>QE4Y?T$66IA7B@W?\nend\n\nThis will be recognizable, if you've seen many, as a uuencoded file,\na common encoding for non-ascii files.  The header line suggests\nthat it is a graphics file.  Tons of these types of files are sent\nacross email networks every day.  Sending your encrypted messages\nin this form would give you a lower profile.\n\nStill, if someone goes to the effort to uudecode your message,\nand examines the resulting file, it will be obvious that it's not\na GIF file because it lacks the proper headers.  Instead, with\nthe current PGP implementation it will be obvious that it is in\nfact a PGP file, because the header format matches the PGP spec.\n\nAgain, I think it would be better if PGP in this mode were able to\nproduce a file without headers which will give away what it is.  Even\nbetter would be the ability to mimic headers of some other types\nof files, such as the .ZIP, .ZOO, or Unix \"compress\" format which are\noften used in binary files people mail around.\n\nAnother thing that I think is kind of bad about PGP in the context\nof avoiding traffic analysis is that it puts the key ID of the\ndestination person in the header.  There was some discussion during\ndevelopment of a mode in which no key ID information would be in the\nheader; the only way you'd have of knowing if the message was for\nyou was to try decrypting it.  (There is a checksum which is used\ninternally to tell if the decryption was done with the right key.)\nThis way you could broadcast messages to some group, and no one could\nknow which person in the group you were sending to.\n\nThese \"anonymous destination\" messages could be encoded with a key\nID of zeros, and the PGP software could easily be modified to let\nthe user try a decryption on such a message, reporting success or\nfailure.\n\nHow useful do these kinds of features seem to people?

This is the approach discussed in the last several days\nhere.\n\nShielding a room is common is certain applications, such as at NSA\n(where the entire windowless building is so shielded), in component\ntesting labs, and so on. Such rooms are called Faraday cages.\n\nIt so happens that in 1972 I worked inside such a Faraday cage (in the\nlabs at UCSB of then-young Paul Hansma, now famous in the nanotech\ncommunity for his AFM imaging of cells and other biological\nmaterials). The shield consisted of copper screen mesh\n(fine-pitch...perhaps .5 mm gaps) mounted on a wooden frame, with 2\nlayers and an air gap between them. \n\nAttenuation depends on frequency, of course, and a wire mesh screen\nlets through some frequencies (light, for example!). How many dbs of\nattenuation at \"frequencies of interest\" depends on a lot of factors.\nExtremely high frequency signals, becoming more common in computers as\nprocessor speeds exceed 50 MHz, are very hard to shield, due to the\nshort wavelengths.\n\nI suspect if the boys in the antenna-equipped vans are parked outside\nyour home, nearly any leakage is too much. But there are cheaper ways\nfor your secrets to be learned. In other words, there are more\npressing concerns.\n\nI would estimate that shielding an entire room would be expensive,\nperhaps costing $5K or more ot do a good job. Building a smaller\nroom-within-a-room might cost a little less.\n\nListening to a radio is one very crude way of monitoring your own\nRF emissions, if you don't have access to specialized gear.\n\nUsing a laptop helps. (I have an old GRiD Compass, with plasma\ndisplay, bubble memory, and a black magnesium case...it is definitely\nless RF-noisy than my PowerBook, and a lot less noisy than my IIci.)\n\n(Perhaps Phil Karn can comment on strategies)\n\nBTW, we've talked about setting up our own \"van Eyck radiation\"\nsystems to see just how easy it is to monitor computers. There is a\nlegend, possibly urban, that the NSA did indeed try to block\npublication of papers on the \"van Eyck\" effect. This fits part of what\n\"Treason\" was saying, though not all of it. (And there is no law\nsaying you can't try to shield your computers, or speak in a low\nvoice, for that matter.)\n\n--Tim\n\n-- \n..........................................................................\nTimothy C.

In broader legal terms,\nevery other communication system avoids eavesdropping on mail.\n \n \nP.S. To understand how powerless you  are to prevent encrypted text, read \nthe leftmost letter of each sentence in the last three paragraghs \ndownwards...ahem.\n \n===========================================================================\n\n He raises a valid point.  Sysops who are so paranoid about encrypted mail \nbeing sent through their systems should realize that they are really powerless \nto prevent it if somebody is determined enough to send a coded message to \nsomebody else.  \n\n I've sought legal opinions in Canadian law (I don't know how it is in the \nU.S.) and I've discovered that the less I know about mail passing through my \nsystem, the safer I am.  If I keep every message on my system, and read them \nall, then I can be held liable if somebody routes something illegal through my \nsystem and it slips by me.  If I kill all passthrough mail, and read nothing \nexcept what is addressed to me, I am operating under common carrier status, \nand can't be held liable any more than Federal Express or UPS could.\n\n As a result, it's actually better to *encourage* people to send encrypted \nmail through your system.  The belief that if people are sending encrypted \nmail they're doing something wrong is a fallacy... then again, I'm preaching \nto the converted here.\n\nCheers,\n Jesse.\n\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n * Origin: On a Clear Disk You Can Seek Forever (1:225/1)\n--  \ntom jennings - via FidoNet node 1:125/555\n    UUCP: ...!uunet!hoptoad!kumr!fidogate!111!tom.jennings\nINTERNET: tom.jennings@f111.n125.z1.FIDONET.ORG", "body_length": 3181, "has_pgp": false, "flags": [], "parent_id": "3230.2AE6EFBC@fidogate.FIDONET.ORG", "children_ids": [], "is_thread_root": true, "orphan_status": "matched_by_quote", "normalized_subject": "drugs for sale", "quote_match_score": 2, "thread_id": "thread_a00e529132b3115a"}, {"id": "960a268a954c574e", "year": 1992, "source_file": "cyp-1992.txt", "line_number": 51886, "from_raw": "pmetzger@shearson.com (Perry E.

At the time of the request, it\nwas not definitely known whether the parts requested by\nGilmore had been re-classified.    \n\nUnder the FOIA, agencies are required to communicate\nresponses to requesters within statutorily prescribed time\nperiods.  Failure to comply with the time limits for response\nconstitutes a denial of the request, giving the requester the\nright to appeal.\n\nWhen NSA violated the first applicable time period,\nGilmore filed an administrative appeal with the NSA's FOIA\nappeals authority.  There is also a time limit for response\nto such appeals.  After this time limit passed without a\nresponse from the NSA's appeals authority, Gilmore filed\na complaint in federal court in the Northern District of\nCalifornia on Sept. 4, 1992, as permitted by the FOIA.\n\nGilmore's complaint alleged three claims:  First, that the\nNSA improperly withheld these documents from him, and\nhad no legal basis for withholding; second, that the NSA's\nfailure to comply with the FOIA time limits constituted a\nform of improper withholding; and third, that the NSA in\ngeneral engages in an illegal pattern or practice of routinely\nviolating the FOIA time limits, which should be declared\nillegal and enjoined.\n\nIn the period between the initial FOIA request to NSA, and\nthe filing of the complaint in federal court, Gilmore obtained\ncopies of two of the withheld documents:  Military\nCryptanalysis Parts III and IV, by Friedman.  These copies\nwere discovered in libraries accessible to the general\npublic and were provided by these libraries without any\nkind of restriction.  Gilmore intended to get expert opinion\non the national security risk posed by disclosure of these\ndocuments.  He also reasoned that their very availability\nin such libraries demonstrated that there could be no legal\nbasis for withholding them from a FOIA requester.\n\nAt the time the documents were obtained, Gilmore had not\nreceived any indication from NSA that the documents were\nclassified.  It was therefore possible that the documents\nwere not, in fact, classified.  In addition, FOIA requests for\ndocuments generally trigger agency declassification review.\nThus, even if the documents were in fact classified at the\ntime of the request, it was possible that NSA would decide\nthat they should no longer be classified, and release them\nto Gilmore.\n\nAfter the complaint was filed, Gilmore not only served the\ncomplaint upon NSA, he also served a number of discovery\nrequests upon NSA, seeking to discover information about\nboth the history of these documents and about NSA's FOIA\nprocessing procedures.\n\nIn early October, after NSA had received the complaint and\nthe discovery requests, NSA finally sent its responses to\nthe FOIA request.  NSA informed Gilmore that the documents\nwere not going to be released to him.  NSA said that it had\nlocated WF-3/4 and LC-3, but that LC-4/5/6 had never been\ncompleted because of the death of Lambros Callimahos.\n\nFirst, NSA asserted that the three documents which did\nexist were classified.  WF-3/4 were classified CONFIDENTIAL,\nthe lowest level of classification under Executive Order\n12,356 governing classified information.  LC-3 was\nclassified SECRET, the middle level of classification.\n\nUnder the FOIA, an agency may withhold documents if they\nare properly classified for reasons of national security.\n\nSecond, NSA asserted that the documents could also be\nwithheld under a different exemption in the FOIA.  Under the\n(b)(3) exemption, documents may be withheld if there exists\na statute which authorizes an agency to withhold them.  NSA\npointed to several statutes which arguably covered this\nmaterial.  One of these statutes, 18 U.S.C. Section 798,\nmakes it a federal crime knowingly to disclose classified \ncryptologic or communications intelligence information to\nunauthorized persons.\n\nAt this point, it became clear to Gilmore that there was a\nproblem.  He now knew for a fact that the documents he had\nwere classified (WF-3/4) and that it would be a crime for\nhim to disseminate them.  He could no longer continue with\nhis plan of showing them to other persons for fear of\ncriminal prosecution.  He also feared that should NSA ever\ndiscover that he possessed them, he would be subjected to\nsearch and seizure and the copies confiscated.  (Note that\nalthough the First Amendment Privacy Protection Act\ngenerally protects the press against search and seizure\nfor materials intended for publication where the crime\ninvolves mere possession or dissemination of information,\nit does not apply to any materials covered by the espionage\nstatutes, of which 18 U.S.C. Section 798 is one.)\n\nNSA did not, however, know that he had them.  Gilmore\ndecided that the best course of action was to submit copies\nof WF-3/4 to the federal district court under seal.  By so\ndoing, he would ensure that at least these copies would be\nkept out of the NSA's hands, since it was unlikely that a federal\njudge would relinquish possession of documents material to\npending litigation.  Thus, on November 12, Gilmore made an\nex parte application to file these documents under seal with\nJudge Thelton Henderson, the federal judge hearing his case.\nGilmore also concurrently filed a motion for leave to amend\nhis original complaint in order to address the constitutional\nand other issues arising from his possession of the documents\nand the criminality of disseminating documents found in\nlibraries open to the general public.\n\nIt is important to realize that the criminal statute at issue\nhere does not recognize improper classification as a defense.\nUnder existing law, the government need only show that the\ndocuments were classified by the government, and that they\nare cryptologic- or communications-intelligence-related.  It\nremains unclear precisely what the specific requirement\nunder the statute is, i.e., whether \"knowingly\" means actual\nknowledge of classification, or merely some reason to know.\n\n(That same day, NSA filed two motions of its own:\na motion for a protective order blocking Gilmore's discovery \nrequests, and a motion for summary judgment asking the\ncourt to dispose of the case on the ground that NSA was\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.  In support of its\nsummary judgment motion, NSA filed a sworn declaration\nby Michael Smith, Chief of Policy, explaining why the\ndocuments should be withheld, and why NSA's FOIA\nprocessing procedures were not illegal.)\n\nNSA was served with papers indicating that WF-3/4 had been\nreceived by the district court.  This was the first time that\nNSA knew that Gilmore possessed the documents.  They\nreacted strongly.  John Martin, the Justice Department lawyer\nrepresenting NSA, asked that Gilmore surrender his copies to\nNSA, saying that NSA was very upset and might send its own\nagents or FBI agents to get the copies from Gilmore.  He also\nwanted to know where Gilmore got them.  Martin also suggested\nthat Gilmore might be criminally liable under the espionage\nstatutes relating to possession of national defense information.\n\nNSA regained its composure the next day, realizing that it\ndid not know exactly what Gilmore had.  Although NSA had\nbeen served with papers indicating what Gilmore had done,\nGilmore had not sent them copies of the documents.  Thus\nthey could not know for sure whether the documents he had\nwere the ones they considered classified.  Gilmore agreed to\nsend copies of his copies to NSA for their review, after\nwhich NSA would decide what to do.\n\nDuring this period, tension was high.  Gilmore considered\nfiling an ex parte motion for a temporary restraining order\nagainst NSA and the U.S. Attorney General to prevent them\nfrom both moving against him personally and against any\ncopies of the documents presently on library shelves.  This\nmotion was drafted but never filed.\n\nOn the day before Thanksgiving, NSA announced that WF-3/4\nwould be declassified, and effectively renounced any claim\nthat it could withhold them from the public.  NSA gave no\nofficial reason for its action.\n\nNSA is currently reviewing the third document, LC-3, to\nsee how much of it can be released now that WF-3/4 have\nbeen declassified.  (NSA had asserted in its summary judgment\npapers that LC-3 was based on WF-3/4.)  NSA's review is to\nbe completed by January 15, 1993, at which time it will\nrelease an edited version of LC-3 to Gilmore.\n\nIt is anticipated that this edited version of LC-3 will be\nanalyzed by Gilmore and his experts, and that Gilmore and\nNSA will engage in settlement negotiations to determine\nwhether NSA has satisfied Gilmore's request.  The\nsettlement discussions will also include Gilmore's claims\nregarding NSA's FOIA processing procedures.\n\nThe parties have stipulated that if no settlement is reached\nthe litigation will proceed.  A status conference has been\nset for February 9.  NSA will, if necessary, file an amended\nmotion for summary judgment by February 12.  Following\nopposition and reply briefs, the hearing on all motions will\ntake place on March 22.\n\n[John Gilmore is a member of the EFF Board of Directors. He can\nreached as gnu@cygnus.com.

May\n                      (tcmay@netcom.com)\n\n\nA specter is haunting the modern world, the specter of crypto \nanarchy. \n\nComputer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for \nindividuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other \nin a totally anonymous manner. Two persons may exchange \nmessages, conduct business, and negotiate electronic contracts \nwithout ever knowing the True Name, or legal identity, of the other. \nInteractions over networks will be untraceable, via extensive re-\nrouting of encrypted packets and tamper-proof boxes which \nimplement cryptographic protocols with nearly perfect assurance \nagainst any tampering. Reputations will be of central importance, far \nmore important in dealings than even the credit ratings of today. \nThese developments will alter completely the nature of government \nregulation, the ability to tax and control economic interactions, the \nability to keep information secret, and will even alter the nature of \ntrust and reputation.\n\nThe technology for this revolution--and it surely will be both a social \nand economic revolution--has existed in theory for the past decade. \nThe methods are based upon public-key encryption, zero-knowledge \ninteractive proof systems, and various software protocols for \ninteraction, authentication, and verification. The focus has until now \nbeen on academic conferences in Europe and the U.S., conferences \nmonitored closely by the National Security Agency. But only recently \nhave computer networks and  personal computers attained sufficient \nspeed to make the ideas practically realizable. And the next ten \nyears will bring enough additional speed to make the ideas \neconomically feasible and essentially unstoppable. High-speed \nnetworks, ISDN, tamper-proof boxes, smart cards, satellites,  Ku-band \ntransmitters, multi-MIPS personal computers, and encryption chips \nnow under development will be some of the enabling technologies. \n\nThe State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of this \ntechnology, citing national security concerns, use of the technology \nby drug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration. \nMany of these concerns will be valid; crypto anarchy will allow \nnational secrets to be traded freely and will allow illicit and stolen \nmaterials to be traded. An anonymous computerized market will \neven make possible abhorrent markets for assassinations and \nextortion. Various criminal and foreign elements will be active users \nof CryptoNet. But this will not halt the spread of crypto anarchy.\n\nJust as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of \nmedieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will \ncryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations \nand of government interference in economic transactions. Combined \nwith emerging information markets, crypto anarchy will create a \nliquid market for any and all material which can be put into words \nand pictures. And just as a seemingly minor invention like barbed \nwire made possible the fencing-off of vast ranches and farms, thus \naltering forever the concepts of land and property rights in the \nfrontier West, so too will the seemingly minor discovery out of an \narcane branch of mathematics come to be the wire clippers which \ndismantle the barbed wire around intellectual property.\n\nArise, you have nothing to lose but your barbed wire fences!\n\n\n                   -==--==--==-<>-==--==--==-\n\n\nDate: Wed, 02 Dec 92 21:31:47 -0800\nFrom: haynes@cats.UCSC.EDU (Jim Haynes)\nNewsgroups: comp.dcom.telecom\nSubject: Historical Note on Telecom Privacy\n\nApropos of all the talk on FBI wiretapping, cellular eavesdropping,\netc., I found this passage in \"Old Wires and New Waves\"; Alvin F.\nHarlow; 1936.  He's writing about unscrupulous telegraph operators in\nthe early days.  They would use information in telegrams for personal\ngain, or delay messages or news for personal gain, or sell news\nreports to non-subscribers of the press association.\n\n    \"Pennsylvania passed a law in 1851, making telegrams secret,\n    to prevent betrayal of private affairs by operators.  When,\n    therefore, an operator was called into court in Philadelphia\n    a little later, and ordered to produce certain telegrams which\n    would prove an act of fraud, he refused to do so, saying that\n    the state law forbade it.  The circuit court, shocked at this\n    development, proceeded to override the law, saying:\n\n       It must be apparent that, if we adopt this construction\n       of the law, the telegraph may be used with the most\n       absolute security for purposes destructive to the\n       well-being of society - a state of things rendering\n       its absolute usefulness at least questionable.  The\n       correspondence of the traitor, the murderer, the robber\n       and the swindler, by means of which their crimes and\n       frauds could be the more readily accomplished and\n       their detection and punishment avoided, would become\n       things so sacred that they never could be accessible to\n       the public justice, however deep might be the public interest\n       involved in their production.\n    \n    The judge therefore ordered the operator to produce the telegrams.\"\n\n\n                   -==--==--==-<>-==--==--==-\n\n\n         THE SECOND ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL EFF PIONEER AWARDS:\n                       CALL FOR NOMINATIONS\n                     Deadline: December 31,1992\n\nIn every field of human endeavor,there are those dedicated to expanding\nknowledge,freedom,efficiency and utility.

Actually, I was thinking of using a notebook\ncomputer with 2 serial ports as a prototype/proof of concept.\n\n> These devices have several advantages:\n\nTrue. But there are also disadvantages:\n\nThey generally don't have two serial ports.  This may not seem like much,\nbut is actually a serius problem.  Since they tend to have small screens,\nweak keyboards, and not the greatest comm software, you might not like\nusing it as your window into the cyberspace.  The advantage of a standalone\ndevice with two rs232 ports is that you can continue to use your existing\nterminal, pc or a mac, along with all its conveniences.\n\n> 1. Cheap. $150 or less.\n\nI hope to make my device in this price range or less.  I can not be sure yet\nbecause I don't have a definite hardware design completed, but that is the\nrange I am aiming for.  I don't know, maybe I am unrealistic, but I think\nthat in kit form it could be significantly under $100.\n\n\n> 2. No construction required.\n\nIf this idea ever takes off in a big way (about a hundred orders or so) then\nI have an electronics company that could build them for me.\n \n> 3. Not likely to have trapdoors or other limits, at least not in the\n> hardware, or in the units you buy today at your local electronics\n\nWhile they may not have any intentional trapdoors, since you don't have\nthe full design specs, you can never be sure of everything that is going on\nwithin the machine.  For example, if in my device I have a section of memory\nthat holds the private key, and I clear it (overwrite with nulls) then I\ncan be reasonably sure that if someone was to get the device they would\nnot be able to retrieve the private key from anywhere.  In a machine such \nas a Wizard, you never know where the number may end up, for example in \nsome area of memory used for the auto-resume feature or some kind of\ncache.  If a device was not designed with security in mind it is likely\nto be insecure.\n\n> 6. A fairly slow CPU,\n\nMight severely limit the length of keys you can handle, therefore the \nlevel of your security.\n\n> 7.

New versions of the software (e.g., PGP 3.21) can be added more\n> easily, I suspect, than in a custom-built RS-232 dongle.\n\nI plan to build it as a generic processor with two RS-232 ports.  All the \ncrypto stuff would be handled in software.  So to cope with new formats,\netc. all you would need to do is reprogram the EPROM.\n\nThis is completely unrelated to the topic at hand, but:\n\n> By the way, the same arguments could be applied to using cellular\n> telephones as the base for building/programming portable, personal\n> crypto devices.

Several such vendors\ncould be used, with independent auditors observing the processing\nsteps throughout. (Merely the threat of a surprise inspection is\nprobably enough to head off obvious attempts to insert hardware\ntrapdoors and the like.) This seems like a solvable problem.\n\nThe issue of whether the NSA will let such devices be built is\ninteresting. There was the story of the \"PhasorPhone,\" or somesuch,\nfrom some years back, with the story that the inventor, in Seattle,\nfiled a patent application and got back a statement that the device\nwas now classified and could not be talked about (let alone marketed).\nHowever, I've heard of no such cases recently.\n\nOther countries have excellent wafer fab facilities and could of\ncourse build the chips and the complete units.

This only makes sense if RSA were inherently much\nfaster than IDEA. In fact, IDEA is orders of magnitude slower than\nRSA; thats the whole reason that we use IDEA session keys encrypted\nwith RSA and not RSA itself to encrypt the message -- RSA is way too\nslow. The result of this is that trying all possible IDEA keys\ndirectly to break the cypher is far far faster than trying to encrypt\nall possible IDEA keys with RSA. Now, since the security of IDEA\ndepends on it being secure from brute force attacks like trying all\npossible IDEA keys and seeing which one produces a good message, the\nresult is that if IDEA is secure, PGP is certainly secure from the\nattack you mention.\n\n>The most important factor in this attack is the length of the IDEA\n>key.

The\nrandom number generator we are discussing here is not suitable for\nmaking one-time pads.  If you want one, build it.

This meeting will be\nbring-your-own-pillow (or chair), since it will be held in largely\nempty space.  Directions are at the end of the message.\n\nAttendance is transitive trust, arbitrarily deep.  Invite whoever you\nwant, and let them do so also, and so on.  Invite them also to join\nthe mailing list.  Do not, however, just post the announcement.  Time\nfor that will come.\n\nI'd like everyone who plans on attending the meeting to send me,\nhughes@soda.berkeley.edu, a message telling me so.  I'd like to get a\nrough head count before Saturday for game planning.\n\nWe are starting at noon because of popular demand.  Eat beforehand or\nbring a burrito or something.  It will be fine to eat during the first\nsegment; it won't be any more disruptive than the game is.\n\nBring your PGP public key for in-person key distribution, preferably\non diskette.  We'll need a portable PC or three to do key\ndistribution; if you have one you can bring, post to the list and tell\npeople.\n\nWe realized after the first meeting that a strict schedule was\nnonsense.  This meeting has a very informal schedule.\n\n\nSchedule\n--------\n\nStarting at noon, we're going to play session two of the\ncrypto-anarchy game, in which players try to conduct business under\nthe watchful eyes of others.  We want to play for two hours and then\nhave discuss experiences afterward for about an hour.  Some of the\nimprovements over last time will be flatter denominations of money,\nwider distribution of commodities, more watchers (governmental and\notherwise), and perhaps some pre-printed forms.\n\nWe'll take a break to regroup for about ten or twenty minutes.\n\nFor the second half we'll talk about the security of remailers.  I'll\nlead the discussion.  We'll be designing protocols and analyzing\nattacks and defenses.  I've done this with DigiCash for electronic\nmoney protocols, and remailers are much easier, but still probably\nmore than an afternoon's discussion.  We'll do this until six or so,\nwhen people will have to start leaving.\n\nEveryone who wants to will go out for dinner.  I don't know the\nrestaurants down there; perhaps someone could suggest one?\n\n\nDirections\n----------\nIt's at 1937 Landings Drive, Mt. View.  101 to Amphitheatre Parkway\n(the bay side of Rengstorff Ave), go right at the first light,\npass a right turn, and just before the road crests a tiny hill,\nturn right into the Landings complex.

This is a subject on\nwhich rational public discussion is essentially non-existent in this\ncountry. Let me first state that I do favor the legalization of drugs,\nand I am a committed libertarian (as I suspect are many of the people\nin this group).\n\nHowever, I think it is unwise to tie cryptography in with this issue.\nCommunications privacy is *too important* to take the risk that it\nwill get caught up in the current hysteria of the New Prohibition.\nThere have already been enough government attacks on cryptography that\nwe do not want to give them any more ammunition.\n\nI think that if we are committed to getting cryptographic technology\nin wide use, and spreading true privacy and information security\nthroughout the world, then we need to take careful account of the\npolitical and social factors, as well as the technical. In order to be\nsuccessful, this needs to be not just a development project, but also\na marketing campaign.

I hope he's\nright, but I doubt it. Since many of his comments are relevant to the\nparallel discussion going on in the \"Cypherpunks\" list, I'm cc:ing\nthat list.\n\nDuncan Frissell writes (from Britain):\n\n> Why we won't have a cashless society - \n> \n> 1) 60% of US personal transactions (by number not value) are still in cash.\n\nBut here in the States nearly everyone has either a credit card or an\nATM card. Most supermarkets now take plastic...ATM/credit card readers\nare installed in the checkout lanes. The clerks tell me they actually\nprefer the plastic, as so little work is needed. (Much faster than\nchecks, which most people not using plastic use). This installed base\nof card readers already covers about 80% of all common transactions, I\nwould estimate.\n\n> 2) Bribe income of the rulers would be affected.\n\nA good point, also made by Keith Henson (in e-mail). Politicians want\ncash for off-the-record transactions, their sexual liaisons, etc.\nMaybe the corruption of politicians will be our salvation! (More\nlikely: exemptions...Congress exempts itself from many laws. Also, the\nvarious onerous financial disclosure laws directly affect politicians,\nand they made it into law.)\n\n> 3) The illiterate, the retarded, and those with poor management skills depend\n>    on a cash accounting system to run their lives.  They would not be able\n>    to survive in a card-based economy.  20% of the US pop. have no checking\n>    accounts and 40% have no plastic.\n\nI notice plenty of semi-literate folks handing their plastic to the\ncashier! Those without checking accounts tend to use \"money orders,\"\nthough, so mandating a conversion would be possible. Many of those\nwithout checking or plastic accounts simply don't \"qualify.\" (Trend:\nqualification standards have been dropping every year) A\ngovernment-run credit/debit card program would ensure that everyone\ngot a card. Illiteracy is no problem, as there is virtually nothing to\nread or write when using plastic. (Adding voice synthesis to some of\nthe card readers would even be seen as a selling point with the blind\nor physically disabled.)\n\n> 4) The destruction of the Underground Economy would be socially regressive\n>    since it would fall most heavily on the poor.  Poor households spend twice\n>    their reported income.\n\nPossibly true, but this won't cut the mustard when it comes to passing\nthe laws. The laws will be presented as a way to \"close the loopholes\"\non the rich, not to soak the poor.\n\nThe talk of a \"welfare credit card\" to deal with the theft of welfare\nand social security checks (a big problem in the U.S., obviously\naffecting mostly the poor) will likely result in some form of\ngovernment-mandated card system in the next couple of years. \n\n> 5) The destruction of the Underground Economy would hurt the Gross Domestic\n>    Product and cause recession.\n\nProbably not a concern to the planners, but perhaps. It is not\npolitically correct to talk about this.\n\n> 6) Foreigners need to be able to participate in the system.  Unless *all*\n>    nations jointly go to an electronic payments system, there will be loopholes\n>    that domestic residents can exploit.\n\nBut foreigners already have to comply with U.S. banking laws (though\nof course they often don't, but that's another story). Foreigners\nplanning to convert pounds or francs to cash dollars would simply\nconvert them to electronic dollars, \"charging\" up their\ndebit/credit/etc. card. (As a parallel, the law from 1933 to 1976 or\nso was that Americans could not possess gold in any form except\njewelry or rare coins. Other countries had no such laws. Did we see\nBritish visitors flouting the laws by spending gold guineas?)\n\n> 7) As long as foreign practices differ, domestic residents could get overseas\n>    Visa debit cards and ATM cards and avoid the domestic social controls.\n\nThis could be a real stopper. Perhaps the U.S. and its New World Order\nwill push for a nearly simultaneous conversion, as part of the GATT\ntalks, the various monetary talks, etc.\n\nAlso, using foreign-based cards could simply be declared illegal.\nTie-ins to Immigration and Passport control could allow foreign\nvisitors to use their foreing cards for, say, 90 days, or\nwhatever....this would also be a way to control illegal immigrants who\noverstay their temporary visa. The cleanest solution would be to tie a\n\"tempory visa\" to a \"temporary VISA\" (pun intended), in which a\nvisitor would receive a card upon arrival, just as he now changes his\nfrancs and marks for dollars.\n\n> 8) The vast majority of the world's population is still in a cash or barter \n>    economy and could not be converted to plastic.  This would leave overseas\n>    cash that would be a system loophole.\nSee above.\n\n> 9) There is now no central financial authority.  Electronic payments are \n>    transmitted to the payor banks by various networks and the banks themselves\n>    authorize payment.  A central authority would be expensive and technically\n>    challenging.\n\nAh, but these clearinghouses are becoming more tightly integrated. A\nVISA transactions costs about $0.10, and this is dropping yearly. A\ntypical transaction can be sent out over phone lines in seconds and\nover high-speed ISDN lines in fractions of a second. Fiber optic lines\nmake it ridiculously easy.\n\nBesides, it it not necessarily the case that there would be one\ncentral authority which would validate transactions (that would be too\nvulnerable to single-point failures and sabotage). Transactions would\nmostly be similar to today's transactions, with records sent\nperiodically to the government(s).\n\n\n> 10)A central financial authority would exceed the institutional abilities of \n>    current international arrangements, would be opposed by the banks (cost and \n>    independence), would constrain the growth of the financial services industry\n>    and would run counter to the trend of financial deregulation.\n\nHere in the U.S. the banks have acquiesced to nearly all of the\nonerous new reporting regulations (cash transactions over\n$10,000--soon to be less--and disclosure laws) resulting from the War\non Drugs. Banks are now creatures of the government, jumping when told\nto. Also, when the various laws are seen as _profit sources_ (as in\nthe FBI's Digital Telephony Bill, which would compensate phone\ncompanies for tapping customers) then banks will be happy to add a\nservice charge to cover their expenses.\n\nFurthermore, and this goes to your point below as well, banks will\npush for legislation that forces theri competitors to do exactly the\nsame as they are doing. There are virtually no new banks appearing in\nthe U.S....they want a nice, safe, profitable world, not competition.\nForcing all transactions to go through them would fit their fondest\ndesires.\n\n> 11)The Iron Law of Regulation.  Regulations create profits for their avoidance\n>    and eventually break down as people take advantage of those profit \n>    opportunities.  Financial deregulation throughout the world in '80s was \n>    *not* caused by a decision of governments to give up power.  Deregulation\n>    was an acknowledgment that old controls were dead.\n\nBanks are suffering as new alternatives have appeared. Hence the talk\nfo repealing the Glass-Steagall Act. Banks may see a cashless system\nas their way to get back into the center of things.\n\n> 12)Networks were originally thought to be centralizing.  In practice they have \n>    proven to be decentralizing.  How many machines/people access Internet?  Who\n>    has central control over Internet?\n\nThe Internet may be physically decentralized, but logically it is very\ncentralized, in the sense that all messages to newgroups appear in one\nvery large feed, albeit sent out in pieces. That is, everybody in the\nworld is basically seeing the same \"sci.crypt\" group.\n\nMore to the point, the credit card clearinghouses are amazing\ncentralized (logically, if not physically...and a friend of mine who\nconsults for VISA headquarters--located in the Bay Area--says nearly\nall VISA transactions flow into their facilities). I can access my\ncredit card balances nearly anyplace in the world. How's that for\ncentralization? \n\n> 13)An encrypted, anonymous, zero-knowledge-proof-credentialed market could be \n>    conducted without reference to an external government-controlled payment\n>    system.\n\nHere we agree, completely. This is my hope. If we can deploy our ideas\nquickly enough, the scenario I describe may be headed off.\n\n> These are just a few of the problems to be overcome.  A change that massive \n> would upset so many apple carts in the US and abroad that I don't think it is\n> much of a risk.\n> \n> Duncan Frissell\n\nThank you, Duncan, for your incisive comments, even though I disputed\nmost of them.

That's why I \"introduce\" Tom Jennings, John\nGilmore, and Eric Hughes...clearly they need no introduction to\nreaders of _this_ list (although a lot of new folks have signed up\nrecently, I hear).\n\nBy the way, I just picked up the latest \"Mondo 2000.\" Our own Jude\nMilhon's article, \"The Cypherpunk Movement,\" is on pp. 36-37 (Issue\n#8). The address \"cypherpunks@toad.com\" is mentioned, so we may get\neven more new folks. Also some good stuff on MindVOX, phreaking, etc.\n\n--Tim\n\n\nHACKERS CONFERENCE REPORT\n\nI just returned from Hackers 8.0, held 6-8 November in Lake Tahoe,\nCalifornia. Approximately 170 attendees this year.\n\nSome Highlights:\n\n* Our crypto session went extremely well. The talks were on PGP and\nFidoNet, Diffie-Hellman key exchange for rlogin, digital\ntime-stamping, and anonymous remailers. More comments later.\n\n* Mike Godwin of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) spoke on the\ndeveloping conflict between personal privacy and law enforcement,\nincluding comments on the \"key registration\" trial balloon I posted\nabout earlier. (Godwin told me he believes the Denning proposal is\ndeadly serious, that the Department of Justice has put a high priority\non limiting the use of cryptography.)\n\n* Hacking was well represented. Besides our crypto panel, sessions on\ncellular phone phreaking and illegal mods to telecom equipment drew\nlarge crowds (a \"how to\" talk on reprogramming the 8051 micro in the\nOki 900 cellphone was especially useful).\n\n* Eric Drexler gave a talk on nanotechnology (surprise!), with an\nemphasis on needed work in the next couple of years. Drexler argued\nthat proto-assemblers could be built in as short as 16 years, though\nthere was some skepticism expressed. He also presented a calculation\nthat the \"cost\" of delaying nanotech is $25 billion a _day_. (I\nsuggested we all skip dinner that night and instead put in another\nhour in the labs!)\n\n* Marvin Minsky answered questions, saying he rarely prepares in\nadvance. AI, robotics, gene expression in embryos, and software were\nall covered.\n\n* Allan Huang of AT&T gave an energetic 90 minute talk on optical\ncomputing, going from optical deconvolvers to \"computer origami\" to\noptical switches to Sagnac fibers that can store light pulses 6\nfemtoseconds long! Definitely the most stimulating talk.\n\n* Demos in the machine room were better than ever. The \"Reality\nEngine\" from Silicon Graphics displayed photorealistic simulations.\nLots of Suns, NeXTs, and Macs. Films of SIGGRAPH papers, chaos and\nfractals, and artificial life were shown at night. Rudy Rucker's\nsession on cellular automata went well.\n\n\n\nMORE ON CRYPTO\n\nSince cryptology and the activities of the \"cypherpunks\" mailing list\nare of central concern to me, I'll concentrate on those topics.\n\nOur panel was in \"prime time,\" mid-Saturday afternoon, with about 100\nin attendance, including a couple of journalists (notably John Markoff\nof the \"New York Times\"...if anybody sees an article on this by him,\nplease send me a note about it, OK?). The audience had been prepped\nfor crypto by the comments Friday night by Mike Godwin of the EFF and\nby a 3 hour rump session on \"Digital Cash\" from 1 a.m. to 4 a.m on\nSaturday (remember \"hacker hours\").\n\nTom Jennings, one of the chief forces behind FidoNet, an \"anarchic\"\nnet made up of PCs talking to other PCs, spoke on efforts to spread\nPGP (Pretty Good Privacy) to as many FidoNet users as possible. It\nlooks like its happening and this will be another avenue to ensure\nthat the \"crypto genie\" gets safely out of the bottle.\n\nJohn Gilmore, an early UNIX/Sun pioneer and current principal at\nCygnus Support, amongst other things, spoke on increasing security\nagainst Internet eavesdroppers by using the Diffie-Hellman key\nexchange protocol for rlogin (for example). This is something we can\ndo fairly soon.\n\nStu Haber and Scott Stornetta of Bellcore (formerly part of Bell Labs)\nreported on their digital time-stamping system. Some document to be\n\"notarized\" is hashed to produce a fairly short number which is hard\nto forge (i.e., it is very hard to find another document which hashes\nto the same value). This hash value is then published in, say, a\nwidely read newspaper. If a dispute arises about the time a document\nwas written, the published has value is persuasive. Bellcore actually\noperates such a service (check the legal notices in the Sunday \"New\nYork Times\").\n\nEric Hughes, a mathematician who worked briefly for David Chaum's\n\"DigiCash\" outfit, described anonymous remailers implemented in Perl\nand now running. He also mentioned Hal Finney's version which embeds\nPGP in the remailer, allowing more security. This generated a lot of\nexcitement, as the ideas of \"crypto anarchy\" became apparent to all.\n\n(John Little, owner and operator of the \"Portal Communications\nCompany,\" a Bay Area-based Internet access service, got excited and\noffered to run the remailers on his system! The genie is further out\nof the bottle. Now if we can only get GEnie to do the same!)\n\nThe spirit of contributing to the larger cause of using crypto to\n_directly_ protect privacy was exhilarating. More people spoke of\nactual code they plan to write (as with Russell Whittaker's offer a\nfew weeks ago to help with ProComm mods). \n\nThere was a real sense that Things Had Changed. With PGP 2.0 arriving\na few months ago (and still spreading), with the onset of the\n\"Cypherpunks\" group (which got a somehat cryptic write-up by Jude\nMilhon in the just-published Issue #8 of \"Mondo 2000\"...but since she\ncoined the term \"cypherpunks\" to describe us, her article can afford\nto be cryptic, no?), and with the \"Hacker Crackdown\" all around us\n(Sun Devil, Legion of Doom, S.266 attempt to ban encryption, FBI's\n\"Digital Telephony Bill,\" and the latest \"trial balloon\" to register\nkeys), the time is right.\n\nIn the next several months I expect the media, via more articles in\nmagazines like \"Mondo 2000\" and by articles on crypto policy, to focus\nin on this issue. Even the \"Village Voice\" is interested in crypto issues\n(theme: crypto privacy vs. Big Brother).\n\nThese are exciting times. If I'm ever busted for sedition, money\nlaundering conspiracy, violation of the Munitions Act, RICO Act\nviolations, or just plain old political incorrectness, carry on the\nfight. The stakes are high.\n\n\n--Tim\n\n--\n..........................................................................\nTimothy C.

This is the\ncompressibility limit.\n\nThe entropy I was referring to was simply the single character\nentropy.  That is, the probabilities p_i in the entropy expression are\nthe probabilities that a given single character appear in the text.\nThis will be higher than the true entropy.  Shannon's estimate for H_1\nwas 4.03 bits/character.  This assumes a 27 character alphabet.

As the author of the words you\ncited in raising your question, and as an advocate of a strict\ncertification hierarchy, let me respond.\n\n\tIt is clear that one can construct a certification system\nwhich is not a tree, but rather is a mesh.  The PGP approach is an\nexample of such a scheme and X.509 permits this.  However, there are a\nnumber of advantages to a hierarchy which have motivated its use in\nthe Internet:\n\n\tIn a pure certification mesh, one acquires certification paths\nby following chins of implied trust.  It is not at all obvious that\nthis approach scales well.  The PGP folks do not yet have significant\nexperience in this regard, so it will be interesting to see how the\nmesh develops over time.  Most folks who have spent considerable time\nexploring this issue believe that unbounded transitive certification,\nwith no required name relationships, is a bad idea.  The rationale is\nthat whatever trust one might accord to an entity may not apply\ntransitively.  I may give a house key to my neighbor to be able to\nopen my house under certain circumstances, but that does not suggest\nthat I would give the key to whomever that neighbor provides his key.\nIt seems difficult to characterize the nature of trust in these\n\"lateral\" arrangements and applying trust transitively is even more\ndifficult.\n\n\tFrom a user interface standpoint, it is generally agreed that\nmost users are not capable of evaluating a certification path.  In PEM\nwe feel that a user should know the distinguished name (or an alias\nassigned by the user locally) of a message originator/recipient, and\nsome indication of the policy under which the user was certified,\ne.g., a short-hand name for the PCA.  This is about all we expect a\nuser to be able to deal with.  The though of a user really paying\nattention to (much less applying meaningful value judgements to) all\nof the DNs in a certification path boggles the mind.\n\n\tI won't clain to understand all the details of what PGP\nprovides for managing key rings.  However, if one were to provide a\nmanagement tool for mesh certification in general, I think it ought to\npermit a user to construct a trust graph expressing the relationships\nimplied by certification paths he acquires.  The user might be able to\nexpress a degree of trust and a level of allowed transitive\ncertification for each entity in the graph.  Disply of this info, to\nallow a user to manage the graph, would be necessary.  All in all, it\nseems to be pretty complex and it is highly questionable if most\n(many?) users could make use of this facility without getting\nconfused.  But, this analysis is based on reasoned speculation, not\nactual experience.\n\n\tThe naming issues is a related, but somewhat indepedent topic.\nDNs provide many good features for use with a certification system.\nOne wants the names to be globally unique and manageable in a\ndistributed fashion.  Being able to express a through, rich name is\nimportant if this technology is ever to expand beyond casual use in\nR&D environments.  Note that DNS names are not great choices.\nAlthough there are close to a million DNS host names, that represents\na very small portion of the population that one wants to serve with a\nsystem like PEM.  Most DNS names are very short and will eventually\nreuslt in collisions as more individual and organizations are\nregistered.  The problem is worst in the U.S. where we have adopted a\nparochial scheme with GOV, EDU, COM, ORG, and MIL at the top, vs.\nother countries which prefix their DNS names with a country code.\nWhat's worse is that many DNS indivdiual names are not very mnemonic\nand thus don't offer much in the way of indentification outside of a\nvery narrow context.\n\n\tThere is sometimes confusion about the role of certificates.\nX.509 makes it clear that they serve only for identification, not\nauthorization.  This is improtant because it is difficult enough to\nmanage them for identification purposes without overloading\nauthorization info on them.  Also, the entities who grant\nauthorization may often be different from those who vouch for the\nidentity of an individual (or organization) and thus this independent\nis appropriate.  Often there seems to be a desire to bind more info\ninto a certificate in support of authorization, but I (and many\nothers) believe this to be a mistake.  One can construct other\ncertificates (like the PACs EMCA has defined) to use public key\ntechnology for authorization, leveraging off of certificates used for\nidentification.\n\n\n\tFinally, there is revocation.  We have adopted both a push and\na pull facility for CRLs in PEM and the PEM CRL format differs\nslightly from that in X.509.  Many folks fail to appreciate the\nsubtleties of CRLs at first.  Hot listing on a CRL says that either a\nkey has been compromised OR a name has changed.  If we have\nfine-grained, organizationally-related names, then these names will\nchange with some frequency and thus CRL entries will arise.  Because a\ncertificate establishes a binding between a name and a key, it seems\nappropriate that only the entity which vouches for this binding (a CA\nof some tyep) should be able to revoke it.  That is the model we use\nin PEM and we add the important feature of having each CA advertise\nwhen it will issue its next CRL, so that user's know when each CRL\nthey hold is obsolete.\n\n\t\n\tPeter, I hope this note helps explain the very terse words I\nput in the PEM key management document.\n\nSteve\n\n------- End of Forwarded Message", "body_length": 6285, "has_pgp": false, "flags": [], "parent_id": null, "children_ids": [], "is_thread_root": true, "orphan_status": "true_root", "normalized_subject": "steve kent on certification trust paths", "thread_id": "thread_0f51f9326d83907a"}, {"id": "1dd15d37d20adf6b", "year": 1992, "source_file": "cyp-1992.txt", "line_number": 13834, "from_raw": "Eric Hollander <hh@soda.berkeley.edu>", "from_name": "Eric Hollander", "from_email": "hh@soda.berkeley.edu", "date_raw": "Sun, 25 Oct 92 21:41:19 PPE", "date_parsed": "1992-10-25T21:41:19", "subject": "Re: entropy measures", "message_id": "9210260440.AA00199@soda.berkeley.edu", "in_reply_to": "9210240620.AA08036@soda.berkeley.edu", "references": [], "to": "Eric Hughes <hughes@soda.berkeley.edu>", "cc": "", "content_type": "text/plain", "body": ">uuencoding will have a slightly lower single-character entropy than\n>the ASCII armor PGP uses because just about every line begins with the\n>letter 'M'.

Only\nafter the message is delivered to my account does this operator\ntake effect.\n\nSyntax: If the first line of the body is the two characters \"::\", then\nthe following lines are appended to the header, up to the next blank\nline.\n\nHere's how it works.\n\nFirst of all, here's my new .maildelivery file:\n\n------- cut here -------\n#\n# field\t\t\tpattern\taction/\tstring \n#\t\t\t\tresult\t(quote included spaces)\n#\nRequest-Remailing-To\t\"\"\tpipe R\t\"perl remailer/remail.perl\" \nRequest-Remailing-To\t\"\"\tfile R\tremailer/archive\n*\t\t\t\"\"\tpipe R\t\"/usr/local/lib/mh/rcvtty -biff\"\n*\t\t\t\"\"\tpipe ?\t\"perl remailer/incoming.header.perl\"\n------- cut here -------\n\nComments are indicated by #.  The Request-Remailing-To lines have been\nthere.  The second of the makes an archive for debugging purposes.  It\nwill go eventually.  The third field, \"*\", indicates all fields, it\nruns 'rcvtty' on my mail; this replaces the function of biff, since\nmail is getting piped to slocal now, disabling biff.\n\nThe last line is the important one.  It says \"If the mail hasn't been\ndelivered by now, run the incoming header rewrite script on it.  If\nthat doesn't work, continue trying to deliver it.\"\n\nNow here's the trick.  slocal has no way of taking the output of the\nrewrite and continuing to process it.  (It should.  It would make this\nwhole job easy.)  So in order to continue processing, you need to\nredeliver the mail.  You could invoke sendmail and mail it back to\nyourself, but that would mangle the existing header.  So the thing to\ndo is to recursively invoke slocal from within the perl script.\n\nHere's the perl script to do all this:\n\n------- cut here -------\n  # First read in the whole header.\n  # We check for the Second-Pass: line to detect infinite loops.\n\nwhile (<>) {\n\tlast if /^$/ ;\n\texit 1 if /^Second-Pass:/ ;\n\t$header .= $_ ;\n}\n\n  # We have just read the last line in the header.\n  # Now we check to see if there is a pasting operator.\n\nif ( ( $_ = <> ) && /^::$/ ) {\n\twhile (<>) {\n\t\tlast if /^$/ ;\n\t\t$header .= $_ ;\n\t}\n} else {\n\t# There is either an empty body or no pasting operator\n\t#   Thus exit with a return code of 1 to indicate that\n\t#   the mail has not been delivered.\n\t\texit 1 ;\n}\n\n# There was a header pasting operator.\n#   So we open 'slocal' as a pipe, effectively redelivering the mail\n#   back to ourselves.\n\n#open( OUTPUT, \">foo\" ) ;\nopen( OUTPUT, \"| /usr/local/lib/mh/slocal -user hughes\" ) ;\nselect( OUTPUT ) ;\n\n# print a \"From \" line to satisfy slocal\n\n@weekdays = ( \"Sun\",\"Mon\",\"Tue\",\"Wed\",\"Thu\",\"Fri\", \"Sat\" ) ;\n@months = ( \"Jan\",\"Feb\",\"Mar\",\"Apr\",\"May\",\n\t\"Jun\",\"Jul\",\"Aug\",\"Sep\",\"Oct\",\"Nov\",\"Dec\" ) ;\n($sec,$min,$hour,$mday,$mon,$year,$wday,$yday,$isdst) = localtime ;\nprintf \"From hughes  %s %s \", @weekdays[ $wday ], @months[ $mon ] ;\nprintf \"%2d %02d:%02d:%02d 19%d\\n\", $mday, $hour, $min, $sec, $year ;\n\n# Now just print out the message\n\nprint $header ;\nprint \"Second-Pass:\\n\" ;\nprint \"\\n\" ; \nwhile (<>) {\n} continue {\n\tprint ;\n}\n\n------- cut here -------\n\nHere's how the perl script works.\n\nThe first loop reads lines from the existing header.  When it sees a\nblank line (regexp /^$/) it terminates the loop.  If it sees a field\n\"Second-Pass\", it knows it has filtered this message before and exits\nwith a return code indicating that the mail has not been delivered.\nThe variable $header is appended with the current header line.\n$header contains the whole header when the loop terminates.\n\nProperly speaking, the Second-Pass test is not necessary to detect\ninfinite loops.  Since the pasting operator gets removed during the\nrewrite, the script won't return an exit status of 0 more times than\nthe pasting operator appears.  But should something get screwed up,\nsuch as a different module adding pasting commands (how? I don't know),\nthe Second-Pass test should prevent infinite recursion.\n\nThe next statement reads another line from the input file.  This line\nis the first line of the message body.  If this line is the pasting\noperator, then header lines are accumulated in $header as before until\na blank line.  The difference is that these header lines are being\nread from the body of the message.  If there is no pasting operator,\nthe script exits undelivered.\n\nAt this point we now have to redeliver the message back to ourselves.\nWe first open slocal as the output pipe.\n\nThe next section is a kludge.  It turns out that slocal strips off the\nout-of-band \"From \" (no colon) line that the mail delivery system\nuses.  In other words, the message which slocal pipes into its pipes\nis not identical to the message it itself received.  This means that\nslocal cannot be directly recursed.  What this section does is to\ncreate a \"From \" line to make slocal happy.  It calls localtime() and\nthen formats those numbers into the proper form.\n\nIt turns out that slocal will deliver this mail without the \"From \"\nline, even to /usr/spool/mail, but it doesn't do so properly.  On my\nsystem, in added some delimiters which I think I've tracked down to\nthe 'mtstailor' file, namely mmdelivery1 and mmdelivery2.  Since these\nare not null on my system, there's some garbage added which screws up\nseparation of the spool file into messages.  Adding a \"From \" line\nfixes that.  This misbehavior may not be so surprising, considering\nthat slocal was \"meant\" to be invoked only in a .forward file.\n\nNow we print the variable $header which contains the whole header,\nincluding newlines.  Using a single string removes the need for an\narray.  We added the Second-Pass line and a blank line for the end of\nthe header.  The final loop prints out the rest of the message body.\n\nThere is another way to proceed to get the same functionality.  One\ncould write a filter to translate the first occurrence only of\n\\n\\n::\\n into \\n. We could then pass the message through this filter\nbefore slocal saw it.  And for now, that would do the same thing.\n\nBut suppose we want more that one rewrite rule active?  Then you would\nonly be able to apply each rewrite rule exactly once in fixed order.\nYou want to be able to rewrite a message and then apply all the\nrewrite rules again.  \n\nAt least one other rewrite rule is planned: automatic decryption.\nSince decrypting a message will completely change the body, and since\nsome of the header fields may need to be hidden, you have to be able\nto decrypt the body and then paste on header lines.  But since you\nneed to indicate an encrypted body by a header line (well, not really,\nbut it's more reliable), and since some people can't add these header\nlines, you need to paste lines before encryption as well.\n\nThus the rewrite rules need to be applied asyncronously and hence I'm\nusing a fairly complex slocal scheme to do a simple filter.\nEventually I hope to write an equivalent to slocal which knows about\nmessage rewrites and simple filters, but that's for later.\n\nEric", "body_length": 7254, "has_pgp": false, "flags": [], "parent_id": null, "children_ids": [], "is_thread_root": true, "orphan_status": "true_root", "normalized_subject": "the technical explanation of \"::\" incoming header pasting", "thread_id": "thread_6bbda2188d2e6ac3"}, {"id": "29e706245ed2857d", "year": 1992, "source_file": "cyp-1992.txt", "line_number": 5209, "from_raw": "Secret_Squirrel@Treehouse.COM", "from_name": null, "from_email": "secret_squirrel@treehouse.com", "date_raw": "Fri, 9 Oct 92 10:05:09 PDT", "date_parsed": "1992-10-09T10:05:09-07:00", "subject": "+-=*^", "message_id": "9210091712.AA27717@atdt.org", "in_reply_to": null, "references": [], "to": "cypherpunks@toad.com", "cc": "", "content_type": "text/plain", "body": "re: Interface for re-mailer; why not hitch it to emacs or something?\n \nre: problem with key distribution; right, OK, I hadn't thought that\nthere might be a security problem with casually giving someone your\nkey\nwithout them being able to authenticate that it came from you.

A claim that arises from such knowledge is not met by\nthis criterion.\n\nThe defense of encrypted communications is not a blanket defense.\n\n>Suppose the provider has keys to the encrypted communications?\n\nThen the defense does not apply.  If the provider has keys to the\ncommunications, then they are not encrypted as far as the provider is\nconcerned.  The question is not the _form_ of the communications, but\ntheir _legibility_.\n\n>Suppose those keys are only to be used under duress (e.g. under a\n>court order)?\n\nIf the keys are in the possession of the provider and the provider and\nthe user have an agreement that the provider is not to use them in any\nway other than archiving them, then the law cannot expect the provider\nto routinely breach that agreement to search for possibly illegal\ncontent.  The court may then subpoena these keys if necessary.\n\n>Suppose the provider is a parent and the user is their teenage\n>daughter?\n\nThe defense of encrypted communications is not germane here.  There is\na parent/child relation which creates a claim which the encrypted\ncommunication defense is irrelevant to.\n\n>Suppose the encryption is easily breakable?\n\nThe test of due diligence may be applied.  If the state of the art is\nthat the encryption is unbreakable, then the communications should be\nconsider to be encrypted.  If the cipher is automatically crackable,\nsuch as monoalphabetic substitution, then the communications should be\nconsider _not_ encrypted.  Remember, the question is not _form_, but\n_legibility_.\n\n>The principle you are looking for is that if the service provider has\n>no *control* over the content, then they should have no *liability*\n>for it either.  \n\nNo, this is not the principle I was getting at.  I was referring to a\nprinciple which was more restricted in its use but which is also\nclearer in its interpretation.\n\nThis defense is a subset of the defense of no control.  If you can't\nread the content, then _a fortiori_ you can't control it either.  It's\nreally very clear that if you have no basis for distinguishing\ncommunications except for size, time, sender, and recipient, that you\ncan't act on anything that passes through the system.\n\n>The courts are gradually making that happen.  \n\nThis is a good sign.  I heartily approve.  But it is easier to define\nlegibility with regard to encryption than it is to define control.\nReferring to encrypted communications is much less ambiguous and\nshould be considered a step in the larger direction.\n\nEric", "body_length": 3480, "has_pgp": false, "flags": [], "parent_id": "9210230728.AA25822@cygnus.com", "children_ids": [], "is_thread_root": false, "orphan_status": "has_parent", "normalized_subject": "keystone", "thread_id": "thread_a00e529132b3115a"}, {"id": "fe66feed4e428acf", "year": 1992, "source_file": "cyp-1992.txt", "line_number": 50892, "from_raw": "UFLTAI%MEMSTVX1.bitnet@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU", "from_name": null, "from_email": "ufltai%memstvx1.bitnet@cunyvm.cuny.edu", "date_raw": "Thu, 17 Dec 92 15:33:28 PST", "date_parsed": "1992-12-17T15:33:28-08:00", "subject": "abusing the system?", "message_id": "9212172333.AA12866@toad.com", "in_reply_to": null, "references": [], "to": "cypherpunks@toad.com", "cc": "", "content_type": "text/plain", "body": "Hiya,\n        One of the newsgroups I was reading have this persistant \"tester\" who\nuses the anon service in Finland.

Encrypted traffic should become the norm, not the exception.\nFlagging that you're sending encrypted traffic should be encouraged.\nWhen questioned about this, people should respond in shocked tones\n\"What do mean?  Aren't you encrypting _your_ email?\" and then proceed\nto suppress gentle laughter at them when they say no.\n\nWhen it's cool to encrypt, only the uncool will be plain.\n\nSo, then, more peer pressure!  Consider someone asking you about your\nencrypted mail to be an opportunity to start a conversation about\ntheir position on personal privacy.  When your sysadmin asks why your\nmail can't be read, tell him you are defending your privacy and ask if\nthere is any problem with that.  Then, when the sysadmin puts in a\nfilter for PGP traffic, use innocent mode.\n\n>Another thing that I think is kind of bad about PGP in the context\n>of avoiding traffic analysis is that it puts the key ID of the\n>destination person in the header.  \n\nAbsolutely.  Ditto for signatures.  Both should be able to be\nselectively removed.  In any case, it should be possible to have\nnothing appear on the outer envelope.\n\nAnother feature for PGP would be automatic message padding.  To\nproperly do a mix you need to quantize the message lengths.  If PGP\nwere to automatically pad with random data, it would save a lot of\nintegration work for the mix.

Re the latter, this isn't the same thing as blind\n\nI doubt this'll work. You're welcome to try, though. \n\nWe had this same discussion in a nanotech group I attend (Ted\nKaehler's \"Assembler Multitude,\" in Palo Alto), where the concern was\nabout the \"grey goo\" that could result from replicator development.\nSeveral folks recommended that the best approach to handling malicious\n\"nanotech hacking\" is _education_, just as George is recommending for\nwhat might be called \"malicious crypto.\"\n\nThe problems are:\n\n1. Moral education (= Christian, in the West) has been tried for\ncenturies, with little apparent effect on murders, rapes, war, and\npillage. I won't knock religion here, but the teachings don't seem to\nhave much of an effect.\n\n2. There's usually some fringe, which may be 10% or which may be 1%,\nwhich does the _opposite_ of the mainstream teachings. For example,\nlet us suppose George successfully organizes the \"Young Men's Crypto\nAssociation,\" or YMCA, to go out to high schools and shopping malls to\npreach the virtues of crypto temperance, of the evils of computer\nviruses (a parallel to the crypto stuff talked about here, and an even\nbetter example of \"hacker morality\"), etc.\n\nThis YMCA will perhaps teach some set of values to perhaps 90% or even\n99% of the hacker community it preaches to. But what of the rest? A\ncase can be made that such preaching will _energize_ this minority\ninto action, if only to poke a stick into the eye of society.\n\n3. Practically speaking, how can a handful of we crypto enthusiasts\neven begin to compete with the teachings of other moralists and\nreligious types? We've got other fish to fry.\n\n4. Finally, many of the \"crypto anarchy\" views I've been espousing for\nseveral years now have been seen by some as grossly immoral and\ndangerous. Should the YMCA (the Young Men's Crypto Association,\nremember) argue _against_ such ideas? \n\n\n> obedience, but rather the idea that if there is to be disobedience it needs\n> to be grounded in deeply held personal ethics, as for example in the case of\n> civil disobedience.

There is presumably a code\nword for performing such snooping, but it must be secret.)\n\nI've read that the worst emitter is your CRT screen.  In fact, they\nsay that you can sometimes put a TV-type monitor next to your computer\nmonitor and get a faint, ghosty image of your CRT screen on the second\nmonitor.  If you get this much without any amplification, it's under-\nstandable that high-quality equipment can pick up an image from a\ngreater distance.\n\nThe best way to avoid this, IMO, is to use a laptop.  The LCD display\nof a laptop does not use the large electromagnetic fields that a CRT\ndisplay does.  Laptops also use lower power levels in general so they\nshould emit less.\n\nI don't really know whether the \"raw\" CPU activity of your computer could\nbe picked up and interpreted at a distance.  With as many different\nsignals as there are on the address and data busses, along with all\nthe other wires you have, I can't really see how anything meaningful\ncould be picked up with remote monitoring.  It would seem that they'd\nbe totally jumbled.\n\nSo, for BBS use, where the system is operating automatically, I'd say\nthat it would be OK as long as you don't display any cleartext or\nkey/password information on the screen.  You could just turn the monitor\noff when it's operating.

(or an RS232 break-out box). If crypto\ntech ever becomes illegal, it could even be disguised as one, with some\nspecial signal combination enabling the crypto function.\n\nIt should also contain some out-of-band signal such as an LED to\nindicate that it is actually doing the decryption, instead of the host\nmimicking it.\n\nIf introduced now or in near future, this device could become\nincredibly widespread, since most everybody that is accessing any form\nof e-mail goes at some point through an RS-232 link (either a terminal\nhanging off a terminal server, or a PC connected to a modem).\n\nAlso, it would not require ANY special software on the host or the pc,\nnor any special terminal.  Thus it would work with any of the great\nvariety of e-mail and BBS sysetems that exist, instead of having to\ndeal with each of them individually as a purely software-based approach\nwould have to.  It would also be completely independent of the type of\ncomputer/terminal or operating system used.\n\nYou would send the usual mail command to the host, type the magic\nsequence to the encryption device (or even better, flip a little\nswitch), and then type your message.  The device would send to the host\nthe ciphertext, while echoing the plaintext to your terminal so you can\nsee what you are typing.  The plaintext would never travel further than\nthe RS232 connection between your terminal and the encryption device.\n\nWhen you receive an encrypted message, flip the switch on your device\nto \"decrypt\", and tell the host to send you the message.  The host and\nany intervening networks would only see the ciphertext.  The only place\nthe decrypted text appears is on your terminal.  I think this is as\nsecure as you can get (until a decryption implant can be put in your\nhead :-).\n\nNow, to allow the use of existing tools (pagers, editors, mailers, etc)\nthe device should be completely transparent except when performing the\ncrypto function.  Even then, careful design should make it pretty\ntransparent.  For example if it passed all control characters intact,\nit could be used with a text editor that uses control key sequences for\nmovement.  It could be programmed for most common arrow key sequences,\nand for commands for editors such as EMACS, vi, etc, to pass them\nthrough unchanged.\n\nSame thing for receiving. When decrypting, it should pass through\nunchanged any characters passing through the other way, and should not\ninterfere with terminal control characters, so any mail viewing program\nwould not be affected.\n\nAdditional functions it might include are generation and verification\nof signatures, an echo mode with decrypt/encrypt (so you could store\nthe encrypted texts on your local drive, and to view would just \"ascii\nupload\" them to the device while in a comm program; also you could\nprepare the text of a message locally, while storing the encrypted text\nechoed back. Then you could upload the cyphertext to the system), a\nsimple local editor and viewer, and anything else we have the ROM space\nfor.  Once the basic hardware is developed, there is nothing to stop\none from including any desired features.\n\nIs anyone here already working on something like this?  If not, is\nanyone interested in working with me on developing this kind of a\ndevice?  I have the design pretty much thought out (this post is just a\nsummary).  I also have a clear picture of the prototyping and\ndevelopment process, and am capable of writing the software part.  I\nwould like to work with a partner who knows the hardware part of all\nthis.  I.E. the RS232/UART control, PCB layouts, that kind of stuff.\nAlso, I know almost nothing about the technology of tamperproof memory\nstorage.\n\nThe main objective of this is not to make loads of money (though that\nwould not hurt either) but to increase widespread accessibility and use\nof good crypto technology.  So I would make the schematics and code\navailable, in case anyone wants to be SURE and build one themselves.\nThis could probably also be made available in kit form, that could be\nassembled by the user.  (an interesting parrallel: this is how the\npersonal computer was first distributed... look at the prevalence of PC\nuse today!) This way they can be more sure that it does what it says it\ndoes.\n\nSo, if you have read this far you are probably interested in this.\nPLEASE reply to me or to the list.

Heck, I might even be signing or decrypting totally\npublic information, just to help raise the amount of encrypted traffic\non the net. In this case I might not care at all if my plaintext is\nsecretly recorded or sent somewhere.\n\nBut I would probably NOT be willing to trust the same PC with my\nsecret key, because it would compromise EVERYTHING I have ever\nprotected (or will protect) with that secret key.

Do you understand the\ndistinction here?\n\n>So if the host does not even need to know the dongle exists, it is\n>automatically independent of what type of computer, operating system,\n>communications program or terminal you are using.\n\nI seriously doubt this will be practical, even with constant\ninteraction with the dongle's keyboard. Most palmtop keyboards are a\nreal pain to use, so I would definitely prefer to limit my use of it\nto truly sensitive things, like typing in my pass phrase to decrypt my\nRSA secret key, or perhaps hitting a key to re-enable the device after\nevery N secret key operation requests from the host, or to restart a\ntimer that would otherwise exit the program and clear RAM after a\ntimeout in the event the device is lost or stolen.\n\n>Again, you are trusting the host.  What if the decryption program on \n>the host has been modified to quietly write the plaintext to a hidden \n>file.  \n\nAs I said earlier, your \"fully-functional dongle\" fails to prevent\nthis attack. If it sits on a serial port between your possibly hacked PC\nand the outside world, then it clearly must pass decrypted plaintext\nto the PC where it could still be quietly written to disk.\n\n>Once the host decrypts the file (at a high speed, as you say), you want\n>to view the file, right?

The model I have is a local PC, possibly hacked, with a serial\nport connected to my personal dongle sitting right beside it.\nObviously it would not do to have an insecure link between the PC and\nthe dongle (unless you had encryption on that link, as I suggested in\nthe case of using a remote machine in place of the dongle.) It should\nbe fairly hard to inject your own traffic on my 1-foot RS-232 link,\nespecially if I provide my own cable.\n\n>I have thought of that too.

Because I use a Mac and the Mac version is not out yet.\n\n9. Because the Mac version may NEVER be out.\n\n8. Because my old IBM PC won't read the 3.5\" diskettes my Mac puts\nout.\n\n7. Because downloading encrypted files with ZMODEM, writing them to\nDOS format (with Apple File Exchange), hauling out my Toshiba 1000SE\nlaptop and firing it up, loading the 3.5\" diskette, and then running\nPGP takes 5 minutes per message.\n\n6. Because after doing all of the above, I usually get \"This is not a\nPGP file,\" due to some obscure mistranslation somewhere along the way.\n\n5. Because I barely have the time to read and respond to my ordinary\ne-mail, let alone decrypt mail, respond (on my DOS machine), and then\nreverse the above procedure.\n\n4. Because I'm not yet convinced it is needed. It will be someday, but\nnot for right now. (Getting PGP volume up is a great idea...it's the\nactual decryption that's a pain. Maybe we ought to send dummy\nmessages.)\n\n3. Because ideally our mailers should handle this in a push-button way\n(I know about the security flaws in having a nonlocal host machine,\nsuch as my NETCOM host, do the PGP procedure...I am hoping that\nsomeone will write something that transparently \"reaches down\" into my\nmachine and triggers the computation locally on my machine--and I need\na Mac version, of course. Probably an off-line Newsreader for the Mac,\nlike Nuntius, is needed.)\n\n2. Because I don't give out my PGP key (generated on my Toshiba) to\nall of those who have e-mailed me about it (especially in the wake of\nmy postings about the Denning proposal). The last thing I want is more\ne-mail from people I've never met, sending me their encrypted secrets\nof the universe.\n\n(...and the Number One reason I don't use PGP?.....)\n\n1. Because computers were supposed to make my life easier, and they\nhaven't. \n\nWell, that's enough reasons. I guess I'm just lazy, or have higher\npriorities than to spend 5 frustrating minutes per mail message.\nIronically, I'm not alone. I have heard that even Phil Zimmerman lets\nhis PGP-encrypted messages pile up in his incoming mail, due to the\nhassles.\n\nAs Eric Hughes has noted, it is precisely this pain that will cause\nimprovements to be made.\n\n\n-- \n..........................................................................\nTimothy C.

(Who and where don't matter, just the phenomenon\nitself.)\n\nI used a single bounce without any encryption to send a message and\ngot a query from the owner of the remailer saying \"I couldn't help\nlooking through my remailer archives and noticing....\" and requesting\nmore information from me!!\n\nHoist by my own petard!\n\nSeveral lessons:\n\n* Multiple bounces help, even without encryption, as then the remailer\nsysop can't be sure who originated the message.\n\n* Encryption is of course even more desirable, though a hassle\n(especially for Mac users).\n\n* Remailer sysops should make a point to _not_ look at their remailer\narchives. In fact, they should discard them immediately (for their own\nlegal protection, and for slightly greater trust amongst users, though\nthis is a hazy area...).\n\n(Recall that the \"mix\" on which our software-based remailers are\nloosely patterned are \"memoryless,\" i.e., the tamper-resistant modules\nthat implement the receive-decrypt-store-forward protocol have no\nmemory of the mapping between incoming and outgoing messages. In\nfact, the outside world cannot possibly compromise the protocols to get\nat this information.)  \n\nSo, my laziness in using only a single bounce, combined with the\ncuriosity of a remailer sysop, breaks the anonymity.\n\nNeither surprising nor profound, but I thought you folks would like to know.\n\n\n--Tim May\n\n--\n..........................................................................\nTimothy C.

With several more such remailing sites\n(and recall John Little's offer to place the s/w on Portal), a\ncritical mass of remailers may exist. (A packet remailed through 10\nremailers, each storing 10 such encrypted packets before remailing,\nhas an intrinsic diffusivity of 10^10. Of course, there will be far\nfewer than 10 billion messages, but the point is clear that the origin\nof a message is effectively untraceable.) \n\n* the spread of PGP, onto Internet sites, FidoNet, and hacker boards,\nIRCs, and the like. (I expect the adoption of PGP by the phone\nhacker/phreaker community--the community so far the main target of\nformal charges, as in the Legion of Doom, Len Rose, and Sun Devil\ncases--is setting off alarms in the law enforcement community.)\n\n* the \"Hacker Crackdown\" spreading to \"2600\" (will Cyperpunks be next?\nWill the 150-200 of us get raided?) and mere _meetings_ of hacker\nfolks.\n\n* the incredible excitement over these topics at the Hackers\nConference, with the sense that these are no longer just abstract\nideas.\n\n* the interest by several journalists in covering these matters (more\non this if things develop).\n\n* articles in \"Scientific American\" just in the past\nmonths...David Chaum's work on digital cash, and quantum cryptography.\n\n* the firestorm of comments (over 500) about the proposal to register\ncryptographic keys. \n\nAll of these point to an accelerating situation. Things may get very\ninteresting and very sticky in the next several months, which is quite\na bit faster than I'd expected.\n\nJustice and the FBI may not wait until the next Administration to get\nsomething started.

This\ncrackdown may not need new laws...the existing conspiracy, RICI Act,\nand espionage laws may be enough to \"set some examples.\"\n\nOur next Cypherpunks meeting (Saturday, 21 November) should look at\nsome of these issues. \"Time is of the essence.\"\n\n--Tim\n\n-- \n..........................................................................\nTimothy C.

The list is governed by a privately\nproduced legal code (its in some ways a test of anarchocapitalist legal theory),\nand since the adoption of the code, we've had a reduction of flaming by\na large factor even though we've seen a three fold increase in list size.\nThe content is improving because people know that sanctions will be applied\nfor flaming and that they can actually be kicked off the list, and that being\nkicked off is meaningful. In the long run, all serious discussion groups\nwill likely evolve in this direction, with the lists being closed to explicit\nsubscribers and with meaningful sanctions like ostracism being applied to \npeople that behave in an antisocial manner. Such lists have little reason\nto fear people hiding behind cloaks of anonymity. With digital signatures,\neven the anonymous can develop meaningful reputations and can be sanctioned\nfor failing to live up to those reputations.\n\nPerry", "body_length": 2120, "has_pgp": false, "flags": [], "parent_id": "9212180034.AA23003@netcom.netcom.com", "children_ids": [], "is_thread_root": true, "orphan_status": "matched_by_subject", "orphan_type": "no_in_reply_to", "normalized_subject": "the need for positive repuations", "match_score": 8, "thread_id": "thread_fe66feed4e428acf"}, {"id": "7e4c2af69d70cfd1", "year": 1992, "source_file": "cyp-1992.txt", "line_number": 27879, "from_raw": "whitaker@eternity.demon.co.uk (Russell E.

First,  I start with a clean screen,  then\nplot the dots as they come in.     As these dots are plotted\non the screen,   the dots should be evenly distributed over the\nscreen without \"bunching\" or \"patterns\" developing.\n\n   I know that this is not the best way to determine true \nrandomness,   but it is cheap and inexpensive to do.  \n\n   I also agree that we should all check out and determine if\nthere are other random generators currently available,  and\nwe should compile a list of them to share with the group as\nproposed by Tim May.    Although I haven't yet visited the\ncrypt newsgroups,  I suspect that I should post a query there\nto see if any such puppie exists.\n\n   Then,  there is the speed of generating these random numbers,\nand how we will want to deal with the possibility of inadequate\nspeed.     I suspect that serial transmission at 9500 baud might\nbe easily obtained,   but going much faster withoug \"drift\" might \nbe problematic as Tim May pointed out.\n\n   At this point,   I would now like to get some other feedback\nfrom the group on what Zener noise source to use,   and kick \naround some design ideas.    It would be nice to be able to exchange\nschematic diagrams and pass them around.  I have a Mac,   but\nnot everyone in this group uses them.    So what mechasim can we\nimploy to send schematics around?\n\n   My next visit to the Nets will be this weekend,   so if anyone\nwants to contact me,  they can try me at (510) 769-1268,  and\nit will refer to the number where I'm staying at that time.\nI still have NO permenent home (after long period of unemployment),\nso getting on the Nets daily will be problematic for me.\n\n   I usually hang out in South San Jose,  at my friends VCR Repair\nlab (where this hardware equipment is located),  but have no computer\nset up there until we can set up proper physical security.   That\nnumber is (408) 377-2382.   I am usually there early in the week,\nbecause I can make calls to find work from there on Mondays.\n\n   As I converge into a workable design and if the lab results\nare encouraging,   and acceptable to the group,   I would like to\nbuild 2 or 3 prototypes and pass them around to volunteers for\nBeta testing before making them available to the group as a whole.\n\n   I can get PC boards made via Douglas Electronics fairly \ninexpensivly,   and plan on making them as orders come in,  and\ninitial setup costs would be about $350.     I already have\npeople set up to invest this much already.\n\n   Perhaps it would be prudent to set up a group of other HW\ndesigners and meet physically somewhere to hammer out a design\nand make this a group effort.

Then he goes on to say,\n\n\"Are there technical alternatives that would satisfy all parties?\nPerhaps.  It is certainly the case that the formulation of the problem\nto be solved has never been made explicit for the cryptographic\ncommunity to work on.  I suspect that a solution based on 'escrowed\nsecret keys' might be workable, wherein each user is legally required\nto depost his or her secret key with a trusted third party, such as\nthe user's bank.  Cryptographic hardware and software would only\noperate with public keys that were certified to having their corres-\nponding secret keys appropriately escrowed.  A federal agency could\nthen obtain the secret key, or its use, with an appropriate warrant.\nOnce their secret keys were escrowed, multinational corporations could\neven operate across borders with a high degree of authentication and\nprivacy (except perhaps from court-ordered wiretaps).  Cryptographic\nhardware and software manufactured in the U.S. would not operate\nabroad without public keys suitably certified as having their secret\ncounterparts escrowed in the U.S.  In an extension of this approach,\nusers can escrow their secret keys with several trusted third parties\nin a 'secret-sharing' manner, so that no single third party can com-\npromise the user's key.  While this approach may have its own difficulties,\nit does illustrate that weak cryptography is not the only technical\napproach available.  There may be much better techniques for achieving\na compromise between a number of conflicting national concerns.\"\n\nAt the time that I read this, I thought it was largely a rhetorical\ndevice, making the point that if the government wants to infringe on\npeople's privacy, it should come out in the open and do so, rather\nthan skulking about.  (Like saying, \"if the government _really_ wants\nto stop sexual immorality it would have to put a TV camera in every\nbedroom\".) And of course (I thought) this kind of proposal would never\nbe taken seriously.  I'm shocked that Denning is now advocating it openly.\n\nThis proposal makes it illegal for people to communicate so secretly\nthat the government can't find out what they are saying.  It could\napply to postal mail as well as email - it would be illegal to send\na message via post which the government couldn't interpret.  If this\nis really the government's purpose, then it should also require that all\nprivate conversations be recorded, and the resulting tapes be \"escrowed\"\nsimilarly in case the government needed to find out what was said,\nfor which it would have to get a court order.\n\nAs Tim suggested, this is probably a \"trial balloon\" being floated to\nsee what the reaction is.

They also\npoint to parallels with voter registration:\n\nIt has been well-known for some time that requiring people to register some\ntime in advance of an election, causes a decline in participation.  This\ndecline is most evident among the disadvantaged sector of the population,\nfor various reasons including inability to take time off from work.  Were\nthe disadvantaged to vote en masse, they would most likely weigh in on the\nside of substantial change, particularly change which would shift the\nbalance of power in a more socially equitable direction.  As the\npowers-that-be prefer to maintain the status quo, they are quite satisfied\nwith the fact that the disadvantaged aren't voting in larger numbers.\nHence Republican administrations have (in recent history) blocked efforts to\nsimplify and ease voter registration, as for instance the \"motor voter bill\"\nwhich would automatically create a voter registration when someone gets a\ndriver's licence or car registration.\n\nThe United States is the world's only remaining Western democracy which\nrequires advance voter registration.  This practice had its roots in\nattempts to prevent newly naturalised US citizens from voting, again, the\nresult of prejudice and desire to maintain the status quo.  Now that the\nDems are in power, we might consider tying the crypto key issue to the\nelimination of voter registration, on the basis that both voting and digital\ncommunication are forms of speech which should not be subjected to a\nchilling effect.  \n\nRapid promulgation of decent user-friendly PKSs looks pretty essential at\nthis point.  I'm thinking, how about approaching Apple to see if they'll\ninclude a PKS along with their Macs, as bundled software, sort of like\nHypercard.  Even if the PKS which is used, has some problem with is, as for\ninstance the old trapdoor-knapsack system, **anything** is preferable to\nnothing at all when it comes to getting the public educated.  Does anyone\nhere know any of the main people at Apple...?

I passed over it before\nbecause I was more interested in the social issue, but the technical\none is important.\n\nThe basic technique is the foundation of cryptography: information\ntheory.  For this application, you can just measure the entropy; it\nalone should be able to distinguish between the three sources.  The\nentropy measures how well one can statistically predict the output of\na source.  A random source has eight bits of entropy per byte.  As\nrandomness decreases, so does the entropy measure.  (Mail me if you\nwant references in order to learn this stuff yourself.)\n\nNow line noise, let's say, will appear random.  So its entropy should\nbe right near the maximum, 8 bits.  Text encrypted with PGP using the\nASCII armor uses only 64 characters out of 256 possible, or one fourth\nof the total available.  Its entropy would be 2 bits per character.\nEnglish text is usually around four and five bits per character, if I\nremember right.\n\nTo calculate the entropy, you first make a table (of size 256) of\ncharacter frequencies normalized to the range [0,1].  Call these p_i.\nThe entropy is then (TeX here) $ \\Sum_{i=0}^{256}n - p_i \\log_2 p_i $.\n(The log base 2 give bits instead of natural units).\n\nNow see if this number is in one of the following ranges:\n\n\t[1.5 .. 2.5]\tencrypted text\n\t[3 .. 6]\tregular text\n\t[7 .. 8]\tline noise\n\nThis is a very simple measure.  There are other measures to look for\nthe deviation from an expected distribution, which give much more\naccurate distinctions.  One can very easily separate languages from\neach other just by looking at such measures.\n\nNote that none of these techniques ever look at the content.  Nor do\nthey look at digraph (two-letter combinations) or trigraph statistics.\nIn fact, the content is completely destroyed by the scanning process!\nLots of this stuff is known; this is how the big boys crack codes.\nI'm glad there arose a natural context to explain some of this stuff.\n\nEric", "body_length": 2054, "has_pgp": false, "flags": [], "parent_id": "9210221623.AA00440@spica.bu.edu", "children_ids": ["9210231641.AA11868@xanadu.xanadu.com", "9210260429.AA29646@soda.berkeley.edu"], "is_thread_root": false, "orphan_status": "has_parent", "normalized_subject": "bbs e-mail policy", "thread_id": "thread_3d613b8050d94616"}, {"id": "f39c51c44967f728", "year": 1992, "source_file": "cyp-1992.txt", "line_number": 6639, "from_raw": "gnu@cygnus.com", "from_name": null, "from_email": "gnu@cygnus.com", "date_raw": "Tue, 13 Oct 92 10:53:19 PDT", "date_parsed": "1992-10-13T10:53:19-07:00", "subject": "Re: Mail headers", "message_id": "9210131800.AA10408@cygnus.com", "in_reply_to": "9210131622.AA25597@soda.berkeley.edu", "references": [], "to": "Eric Hughes <hughes@soda.berkeley.edu>", "cc": "", "content_type": "text/plain", "body": "We have standards already for a fully encrypted email system.

There are so many different ways in which people read\nand send mail.\n\nA lot of people receive their mail on some other machine, often\na multi-user machine.  So, the first question is, should the mail\nbe crypted there, or should it be crypted on your personal machine.\nThe second choice is preferable from the security point of view,\nbut that means that you need to download at least your PGP mail\nin order to decrypt it, and it means you have to compose your\nmail on your home machine before encrypting, uploading, and sending.\n\n(Phil Zimmermann had an idea for multi-user systems in which the\nRSA portion of the decryption, which involves your secret key, would\nbe done on your personal machine, then the decrypted session key\nwould be uploaded to the multi-user machine and the IDEA decryption\ndone on the message itself.  This way you only have to upload and\ndownload a couple hundred bytes regardless of the length of the\nmessage.  This would require PGP to be integrated into a terminal\nprogram.)\n\nIf you _do_ download your mail before reading it, you could get in\nthe habit of downloading _all_ of your mail into a big file, then\nrunning a word processor or some more specialized program to\nread the messages, one at a time, and compose replies.  Then, when\nyou were done, you could upload and send the replies.\n\nIf you worked in this mode, which probably few people do, you could\nintegrate PGP by running it on the downloaded mail file before running\nyour WP to read it.  I have a Perl script which runs PGP on a file,\nfinding the PGP messages in it, decrypting them, and replacing them\n_in_the_file_ with their decrypted versions.  (Normally PGP outputs\nits decrypted contents to another file, which is a little inconvenient.)\nThis can make PGP pretty transparent for decryption if you actually\nread your mail in this way.\n\nAnother possibility is to use a WP or mail reading program which has\na \"filter\" mode, one which lets you pass incoming or outgoing mail\nthrough some program, and replace the mail with the results of that\nprogram.  I don't know which programs can do this.  A lot of Unix\nprograms can, like VI and EMACS, but I don't know about PC's or other\nhome machines.  PGP has a filter mode which is designed to be used with\nWP's which can do this.  There have been a couple of messages on\nalt.security.pgp which have advice on using PGP with various Unix mail\nreading programs.  Mark Riordan's soon-to-be-released RIPEM program\n(an alternative, incompatible, RSA public-key program) has some ideas\nin its manual on how to use its filter mode with Unix mail, which mostly\napply to PGP as well.\n\nOne other point: regarding a Mac port: There have been at least a couple\nof messages on alt.security.pgp over the past couple of months from\npeople who have successfully compiled the PGP sources under Think C\non the Mac.  However, as a Unix/PC program, it ends up using a character\nwindow for I/O, which you type into just like you would on a PC.\nThis is unacceptable for Macs, so nobody has released one of these.\nStill, compared to what Tim has to do, it would be an improvement.  I\nthink people should release their executables which work like this as\nan interim crutch version until the real Mac version is available.\n\nHal\n74076.1041@compuserve.com", "body_length": 3338, "has_pgp": false, "flags": [], "parent_id": null, "children_ids": ["9210312101.AA03883@netcom2.netcom.com", "3400.2AF2EC7B@fidogate.FIDONET.ORG"], "is_thread_root": true, "orphan_status": "true_root", "normalized_subject": "why i don't use pgp...", "thread_id": "thread_e5317ed21abfa218"}, {"id": "23447e6f5788c286", "year": 1992, "source_file": "cyp-1992.txt", "line_number": 49459, "from_raw": "avalon@coombs.anu.edu.au (Darren Reed)", "from_name": "Darren Reed", "from_email": "avalon@coombs.anu.edu.au", "date_raw": "Tue, 15 Dec 92 09:05:15 PST", "date_parsed": "1992-12-15T09:05:15-08:00", "subject": "Re: timeofday for randomnessness ?", "message_id": "9212151704.AA15303@coombs.anu.edu.au", "in_reply_to": "9212151555.AA10507@novavax.nova.edu", "references": [], "to": "yanek@novavax.nova.edu (Yanek Martinson)", "cc": "", "content_type": "text/plain", "body": "In some email I received from Yanek Martinson, Sie wrote:\n> \n> > \tgettimeofday(&tv, NULL);\n> > \trand = tv.tv_usec + tv.tv_sec;\n> \n> Someone trying to break your code could find out approximately when\n> the number was generated, then they would have a much smaller search\n> space to try.\n\nThats why you change key 'regularly'...even randomly ?\n\nThen they have to 'guess' when you change keys.

(Ostensibly, the encryption and\nregistration could be done by the user himself, though some means of\nverifying compliance would have to be devised.)\n* To make use of the private key (for example, to read e-mail\nencrypted with the key), the government would have to get a court\norder, present it to the independent agency, take the key back to\nJustice, decrypt it with the private key of Justice, and then proceed\nwith their surveillance and whatnot.\n\nThis is ostensibly like the procedure for wiretapping.\n\nHowever, it would screw up the use of encryption in many ways.\nRegistering a key would precluded frequent key changes, would probably\ncost some fee (on the order of $50, like a driver's license, I'd\nguess), and would of course greatly complicate the use of digital\npseudonyms and all the other neat stuff we've talked about (but which\ncaution tells me not to discuss here on an open and unsecured\nlist...you can check my .sig to see where I stand, of course).\n\nMy hunch is that Denning and the other \"quaint\" (cf.

Discussion of this is in comp.risks (\"RISKS\"), so far, but\ncertainly belongs in this group.\n\nI posted a summary of this position to a private mailing list devoted\nto crypto issues and got a huge response of concerned folks. I don't\nunderstand why this is not a hot topic on sci.crypt, so I'll post\nsomething right now.\n\nHere's my understanding of her proposal:\n\n* Anyone using public key cryptography would be required to register\nthe private key with the appropriate authorities, for example, the\nJustice Department.\n\n* To head off the obvious concerns about the government routinely\nreading e-mail, financial dealings, etc., this registered key would be\nstored at an independent agency after first being encrypted with the\n_public key_ of Justice. (That is, the independent key storage agency\nwould have an unusable key, so _they_ couldn't use it themselves.)\n\n* To obtain a usable form of the private key, Justice would have to\nget a valid court order, go to the independent storage agency, present\nthe order, pick up the key, open it with their own _private key_, and\nproceed to open mail, read communications, etc.\n\nThis is ostensibly the procedure now used for wiretaps.\n\nBut the effect on encryption would be chilling:\n\n-would greatly complicate the rapid changing of keys\n\n-would probably be a way to get \"unlicensed\" crypto programs off the\nmarket (e.g., don't think about using PGP 2.0, as the key registration\nauthorities would either insist on another algorithm, or would send\nthe \"registration application\" to, for example, RSA Data Security for\nlegal action)\n\n-would undoubtedly require a \"fee\" (like a driver's license)\n\n-would interfere with the use of digital pseudonyms, anonymous nets (a\nla Chaum's \"DC Net\" proposal, which some of us are exploring now), and\ndigital money\n\n-would establish the precedent that private communications are not\nlegal, that copies of all private communications must be placed in\nescrow with the government\n\nRegistering keys is no different than, for example, requiring a permit\nfor every public utterance or for registering typewriters, modems,\ncomputers, fax machines, and copiers. Or banning the use of sealed\nenvelopes for mail. In Phil Zimmerman's great words, it would be like\nrequiring all mail to be sent on postcards.\n\nMy suspicion, which Prof. Denning will presumably comment on if she's\nreading this, is that the government folks have come to understand the\nprofound implications of modern crypto and are looking for approaches\nto head off the coming sea changes. Granted, there are serious\nnational security threats in using modern crypto methods, but there\nare in any of the new technologies, such as those listed above.\nBesides, does anyone think all keys will be registered? Hiding bits is\na relatively easy thing to do.\n\nThis key registration proposal is more odious than the \"backdoors in\ntelecom equipment\" proposal discussed here recently.\n\nCan we remain silent as our liberties are taken away?\n\nI think it was John Gilmore who said: \"If encryption is outlawed, only\noutlaws will have encryption.\"\n\n\n-- \n..........................................................................\nTimothy C.

I volunteered to look into this\nwith the hopes of making a cheap and inexpensive device that has\n2 DB-9 connectors (Serial through box) to be used to generate random\nserial data at a particular baud rate.\n\nToday,  I called Newbridge Micro,  they faxed me the data sheets,  and\ngave me the number for a local rep in San Jose.   (408) 258-3600,\nbut I was appalled at the price.    They wanted $52.50 each in\n100 quantity.   So it is clear that if I use this chip,  which really\nis a hybred,   I cannot charge $50 each.    So we have to decide\nwhat to do,   or how much more it will cost.\n\nAfter examining the data sheet,  the chip is probed by a pulse,  and\na bit comes out with an equal probability of a \"1\" or a \"0\".   Sorta\nlike a coin toss.  \n\nI think that the perifery cost of the other electronics,   such as\nshift registers,  or UART which would be necessary to clock the bits\ninto an 8 bit register,  etc,  would cost about $6 - $8 in cost,  then\nI will have to fab the boards.   I have friend at Douglas Electronics\nwho can give me a good price.

This also includes design\ntime and use of an electronics lab to test and get it running.\n\nI wouldn't be able to borrow $6350 to build 100 of them,  and I think\nI can talk the rep into letting me purchase them in smaller quantity,\nso I can build them on demand.

Granger\") \n\nA \"Viewpoint \" piece in  The Institute, November 1992\n\nBalancing National Interests\n\n  The September/October issue of The Institute carried a front page story\nreporting that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is promoting legislation\nthat would require all telephone systems to be designed in such a way that they\ncan be wiretapped by law enforcement officials.  The argument is that\nwiretapping is a key tool in much of law enforcement, particularly in fields\nsuch as drugs, racketeering, conspiracy and white collar crime, and that unless\ncare is taken in the design of future telecommunications systems, this tool may\nbecome difficult or impossible to exercise.  To solve this problem the FBI is\npromoting legislation that would establish design requirements on future\ntelephone systems.  Not surprisingly, civil liberties groups and telephone\ncompanies are reported to be less than enthusiastic.\n\n        While interesting and important in its own right, this controversy is\nperhaps even more important as a symbol of a broader set of conflicts between a\nnumber of important national interests. As a country, we want to promote:\n\n  * Individual privacy (including the right of citizens and other residents of\nthe U.S. to keep personal records private, hold private communications with\nothers, and move about without being \"tracked\".)\n\n  * Security for organizations (including protection of financial transactions,\nand the ability to keep corporate data, plans, and communications\nconfidential.)\n\n  * Effective domestic law enforcement (including the ability to perform\nsurveillance of legitimately identified suspects, and the ability to audit and\nreconstruct fraudulent activities.)\n\n  * Effective international intelligence gathering (including the ability to\nmonitor the plans and activities of organizations abroad that may pose a threat\nto the U.S. or to other peaceful states and peoples.)\n\n  * Secure world-wide reliable communications for U.S. diplomats and the\nmilitary, for U.S. business, and for U.S. citizens in their activities all\naround the world (including the ability to maintain and gain access to secure,\nreliable, communications channels.)\n\n        Just as with most of our society's other fundamental objectives, these\nobjectives are in conflict.  You can not maximize them all because getting more\nof some involves giving up some of others.  A dynamic tension must be created\nthat keeps the various objectives properly balanced.  That socially optimal\npoint of balance may change gradually over time as world conditions and our\nsociety's values evolve.\n\n        An electrical engineer who thinks for a moment about the problem of\nachieving any particular specified balance among the various objectives I have\nlisted will quickly conclude that communications and information technology\ndesign choices lie at the heart of the way in which many of the necessary\ntradeoffs will be made.  We would like easy portable communications for all,\nbut doing that in a way that allows people to keep their legitimate travels\nprivate poses significant design challenges.  Banks and other businesses would\nlike secure encrypted communications world-wide, but promoting the general\navailability of such technologies all around the world severely complicates the\nsignal intelligence operations of intelligence organizations.\n\n        The troubling thing about the FBI's legislative proposals is not that\nthey are being made, but that we lack a broader institutional context within\nwhich to evaluate them.  In making such choices, we need to look systematically\nat all the legitimate interests that are at stake in telecommunications and\ninformation technology design choices, consider the ways in which technology\nand the world are evolving, and integrate all these considerations to arrive at\na reasoned balance.  In the old days, if things got too far out of line in some\nbalance (for example, between freedom of the press and protection against\nliable), the courts simply readjusted things and we went on.  Today, and\nincreasingly in the future, with many of these balances hard wired into the\nbasic design of our information and communication systems, it may be much\nharder to readjust the balance after the fact.\n\n        There are several organizations that should be working harder on these\nissues.  On the government side the Telecommunication and Computing\nTechnologies Program in the Office of Technology Assessment should be doing\nmore systematic studies of these tradeoffs to help inform the Congress; The\nNational Telecommunications and Information Administration in the Department of\nCommerce (or some appropriate interagency committee) should be doing similar\nstudies to develop more coherent and comprehensive executive branch policy; and\nthe Office of Policy and Plans in the Federal Communications Commission (which\nis an independent regulatory agency not directly subject to executive branch\npolicy) should be giving these issues more attention so it can better support\nthe Commissioners when they confront such tradeoffs.  On the non-government\nside, the Office of Computer and Information Technology at the National\nResearch Council might appropriately mount a comprehensive study.

I'll just add a\nfew comments.\n\n> About Tempest.\n> \n> The ability to monitor is real; it's more powerful than you would first\n> imagine.\n\nAnd the NSA has reportedly restricted several papers on this, though\nthey can't do much about the stuff coming from abroad. Their chief\nconcern doesn't seem to be folks like us, but rather concerns about\nvans parking outside high tech and defense contractors and slurping up\nwhat they can from non-TEMPEST (all caps, for some reason) terminals\nand computers.\n\nAnd someone asked about building Faraday cages. Don't even try! In\n1972-3 I worked inside a Faraday cage in the lab of Dr. Paul Hansma\n(who's now famous for his atomic force microscope work--small world),\nand it was real tough to shield against high frequencies (above 500\nMHz). Modern computers run at 50MHz and faster and the signal edges\nare of course much faster. RF emissions are a major hassle, and even\n30 dB of shielding will still mean enough emissions for a dedicated\nlistener to pick up.\n\n> Hal mentions using flat panel displays to combat emissions.  This\n> works, as evidenced by the continued existence of Grid Computer.\n> Remember Grid, who came out with these way-expensive gas plasma\n> laptops around 1985/6?  The reason they sold so many of those and are\n> still around was that a large number of them were Tempest certified.\n> (Even larger revenues!)  I understand that the Tempest spec Grids had\n> a thin layer of gold foil in front of the screen, even so.  Yes, gold\n> thin enough to see through.\n\nBTW, I have one of the original magnesium-cased, bubble-memoried GRiD\nCompasses. Tres elegant (and even \"way cool\"....Not! It heats up\nsomething fierce, with the magnesium case acting as a heat sink). (I\ngot this at Weird Stuff Warehouse, complete with a magnesium-cased\ndisk drive, cables, etc., for $250. Fully functional, but not a lot of\nsoftware written for \"GRiD-OS.\" Maybe I'll bring it to the next\nCypherpunks meeting.)\n\n> monitoring easier.  It's safe to presume that there is some amazing\n> stuff going on.  Read The Puzzle Palace for more hints.  (Like the\n> valley in WV which is one big antenna.)\n\nDitto on this book recommendation: all would-be cypherpunks should\nread James Bamford's \"The Puzzle Palace.\" Though published in 1982, it\nrevealed a lot about such \"No Such Agency,\" so much so that the\ndirector of NSA, upon encountering Bamford at a dinner, refused to\nshake his hand and said \"Sir, I consider you an unindicted felon!\"\n\n> Emissions monitoring is also all economics.  The price to monitor\n> increases with each more sophisticated attack.  CRT's are easy, CPU's\n> are hard.  I would like to see public research in this area, just like\n> there is public research in cryptography.  Until the public has a\n> better idea of what various attacks cost, there can't be rational\n> decisions about emissions security.\n\nI think the longterm solution to this problem is the same as that for\nthe key problem: small, highly portable, self-contained computers for\ndoing the most sensitive work and for providing passwords to remote\nsystems. Smartcards are one approach, though they obviously are highly\nconstrained in what they can do other than act as ATM or VISA cards.\n\n(Laptops are one idea. Following Eric's suggestion that we look into\nTEMPEST issues, perhaps we could \"rate\" different laptops and PCs for\nemissions. Just a thought.)\n\nApple's \"Newton\" PDA (\"Personal Digital Assistant\"), General Magic's\nwhatever (talk to Fen L., who works there, but who won't say much),\nEo's Hobbit-based PDA, and other systems (Sharp, Casio, etc.), offer a\nbetter platform, at least for the long term. With 100 MIPS\nperformance, LCD screens, and no dangling keyboards and cables, these\ngizmos should be favorably positioned for security-conscious\napplications. RF emissions should be low to begin with (and can be\ncharacterized, of course); additional shielding should be easier to\nachieve than with full-sized units.\n\nPDAs also are small enough that people will carry them everywhere,\nthus both enhancing security against tampering, and also making them\nworkhorses for security applications. With a good interface to desktop\nmachines, the critical security functions can be done inside the PDA\n(e.g., accessing a terminal or remote system using zero knowledge\nprotocols, where the PDA answers a challenge question without\nrevealing the actual password or whatever secret key). The announced\nPDAs also have slots for \"PCMCIA\" cards, small credit-card-sized cards\nthat can add functionality and memory.\n\nThe lack of a keyboard in the smallest of these units will be a limit\n(though external keyboards are options...and with some care, these\nkeyboards can even be made TEMPEST class, though leakage will still\npersist. A battery-operated keyboard with fiber-optic link to the PDA\nmight be one approach.). \n\nThe issue of hooking these PDAs to desktop machines and networks is an\ninterestesting one. Wirless links would seem to be risky, except that\nif all critical computations are done _inside_ the PDA then what gets\ntransmitted is not really \"fragile\" (in the eavesdropping sense). I\nsuspect that someone will offer a small fiber optic link (like the one\nI have going between my CD player and my DAT machine).\n\nAnd it will be a couple of years before these become common. But it's\nabout 2-3 years from now that our mission gets really interesting,\nanyway. Digital money, anonymous voting and conferences (imagine using\nwireless, encrypted links in meetings to negotiate without opponents\nknowing..just one of several small business product niches), and all\nkind of other crypto anarchy ideas.\n\nPGP 3.0 for PDAs!\n\n\n-- \n..........................................................................\nTimothy C.

If you can't attend, corner someone on the list who\nwill be there and convince them to represent your position.\n\nEric Hughes\n\n\n\nAGENDA\n======\n\n1.  Key exchange.  Bring a diskette with your PGP public key on it.\nBring a machine which can read this diskette.  Bring extra diskettes\nto collect keys on and to give out.  Let us not be hypocrites and let\nus all know each other's public keys.\n\n2.  Project planning.  We need a list of crypto projects and who is\nworking on them.  This will help coordination and avoid duplication of\neffort.  We need to prioritize the projects to avoid premature\ndevelopment.  We need to create strategies and design criteria.\n\n3.  Project logistics.  We need to talk about the best ways to do\nwidely distributed software development in this fairly anarchic\nenvironment.\n\n4.  Design review.  Hal Finney and I have been duking it out behind\nthe scenes working on a design schema for the next generation\nremailer.  I'd like to present the design and have people critique it.\n\n(would be 5.) We won't be playing the crypto-anarchy game this time.\nIt's not a dead duck, but this time we've got more urgent things to\ndo.\n\n\nDIRECTIONS\n==========\n\nHere is a reposting of the directions to the meeting place. \n------------------------------------------------------------------\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\nSubject: Better directions to the meeting on Saturday at noon\nFrom: gnu@cygnus.com\n\nSomeone asked for better directions, and the original ones were\npretty skimpy anyway.  Here's a better try.\n\n\tCygnus Support\n\t1937 Landings Drive\n\tMt. View, CA  94043\n\nThere's no phone service there yet.\n\nTake US 101 toward Mt. View.  From San Francisco, it's about a\n40-minute drive.  Get off at the Rengstorff Ave/Amphitheatre Parkway\nexit.  If you were heading south on 101, you curve around to the\nright, cross over the freeway, and get to a stoplight.  If you were\nheading north on 101, you just come right off the exit to the\nstoplight.  The light is the intersection of Amphitheatre and\nCharleston Rd.  Take a right on Charleston; there's a right-turn-only\nlane.\n\nFollow Charleston for a short distance.  You'll pass the\nMetaphor/Kaleida buildings on the right.  At a clump of palm trees and\na \"Landmark Deli\" sign, you can take a right into Landings Drive; this\ngets you into the complex from the north.  Or you can go slightly\nfurther along Charleston and take the next right, into a driveway with\na big \"Landmark\" sign in the middle.  No matter which way you got into\nthe complex, follow around it until you are on the side that faces the\nfreeway.  There's a clock tower that rises out of one of the\nbuildings, to the right (south) of the deli.  Enter through the doors\nimmediately under the clock tower.  They'll be open between noon and\n1PM at least.  (See below if you're late.)\n\nOnce inside, take the stairs up, immediately to your right.  At the top\nof the stairs, turn right past the treetops, and we'll be in 1937 on \nyour left.\n\nIf you are late and the door under the clock tower is locked, you can\ngo to the deli (which will be around a building and left, as you face\nthe door), cut between the buildings to the right of the deli, and\ninto the back lawns between the complex and the farm behind it.  Walk\naround the buildings until you see a satellite dish in the lawn.  Go\nup the stairs next to the dish, which are the back stairs into the\nCygnus office space.  We'll prop the door (or you can bang on it if we\nforget).\n\nOr, you can find the guard who's wandering around the complex, who\nknows there's a meeting happening and will let you in.  They can be\nbeeped at 965 5250, though you'll have trouble finding a phone.\n\nDon't forget to eat first, or bring food at noon!  I recommend hitting\nthe burrito place on Rengstorff (La Costen~a) at about 11:45.  To get\nthere, when you get off 101, take Rengstorff (toward the hills) rather\nthan Amphitheatre (toward the bay).  Follow it about ten blocks until\nthe major intersection at Middlefield Road.  La Costen~a is the store\non your left at the corner.  You can turn left into the narrow lane\nbehind the store, which leads to a parking lot, and enter by the front\ndoor, which faces the intersection.  To get to the meeting from there,\njust retrace your route on Rengstorff, go straight over the freeway,\nand turn right at the stoplight onto Charleston; see above.\n\nSee you there!\n\n\tJohn Gilmore", "body_length": 5181, "has_pgp": false, "flags": [], "parent_id": null, "children_ids": ["3765.2B0896A5@fidogate.FIDONET.ORG"], "is_thread_root": true, "orphan_status": "true_root", "normalized_subject": "november 21 meeting, 12 noon, at cygnus offices", "thread_id": "thread_f43d62035597d6ec"}, {"id": "a00e529132b3115a", "year": 1992, "source_file": "cyp-1992.txt", "line_number": 10909, "from_raw": "Eric Hughes <hughes@soda.berkeley.edu>", "from_name": "Eric Hughes", "from_email": "hughes@soda.berkeley.edu", "date_raw": "Wed, 21 Oct 92 22:35:21 PDT", "date_parsed": "1992-10-21T22:35:21-07:00", "subject": "Keystone", "message_id": "9210220541.AA13526@soda.berkeley.edu", "in_reply_to": "9210220333.AA009m7@fnordbox.UUCP", "references": [], "to": "cypherpunks@toad.com", "cc": "", "content_type": "text/plain", "body": "Ah.

My name is Loyd Blankenship. I am\nthe Product Development Manager at Steve Jackson Games, and was the\nemployee raided by the Secret Service that set off the formation of the\nEFF, our lawsuit against them, and much angst within the government. I also\nuse the nome de' plume \"The Mentor\" when traversing the computer underground.\n\nOn to stuff relevant to the list:\n\nA group of us here in Austin have spent a great deal of time discussing\nthe advantages of RSA-encrypted e-mail. I'm putting a BBS back up later\nin the year, and would like to offer secure communications to my users.\nSince the threat of seizure is very real (the feds still have over $10,000\n(1989 street price) of computer equipment of mine since I'm \"still under\ninvestigation\"), this needs to be implemented before the message is ever\nwritten to hard disk.\n\nTo implement this, I'm currently trying to get PGP up on my Amiga, then\nwrite the necessary C & AREXX functions to link it in with my BBS's (DLG\nPro) email function.\n\nThe outgrowth of this was the Keystone project. We're going to attempt to\nget everyone in Austin cyberspace public-key capable, and get a master\nkeyring that will be regularly distributed via a trusted system to other\nnodes in town. Ideally, you would be able to send RSA-encrypted email from\nany bbs on any of the local nets to any other bbs -- even if all you know\nis the destination address. We're going to do this by attempting to make\nthe bbs PGP-friendly. All the user has to do is generate a key pair.\n\nThe two potential weak links in this chain are line security and key\nvalidation. The first is almost insurmountable -- unless the user takes the\ntime to d/l a complete copy of PGP and the Austin Keystone Keyring and\nencrypt the mail on their home system. But if not, then they have to live\nwith the chance that someone is data-tapping. The second will rely on\nface-to-face identification -- this is why we're making this a local effort.\n\nIt will probably be Christmas (when I have a 3-week vacation) before serious\nstrides are made in this, but I'm interested in any comments people may\nhave.\n\nLoyd\n\np.s.

But getting the basic idea usually involves reading\nseveral articles on what RSA, digital signatures, etc., are all about,\nworking out some examples, thinking about it, drawing pictures with\nother folks, and finally having an \"Aha!\" experience (in Werner Erhard's\nterms, you \"get it\"). The ASCII nature of the Net is not conducive to learning\nthis stuff, despite the excellent summaries of crypto by Marc R. and Perry M.\n\nThe almost-latest \"Scientific American,\" August, has an article by David Chaum\non digital money, and the latest \"Spectrum,\" available at selected newstands,\nhas several articles on security and cryptography. Also, there are lots of\nbooks. Look 'em up in a university library or flip through them at a large\ntechnical bookstore and pick the one you like the most. (I like a slim\nSpringer-Verlag paperback, \"Modern Cryptology,\" by Gilles Brassard, 1988, as\na good intro to \"modern\"--as opposed to \"classical\"--crypto.)\n\nIf the stuff in this posting, and on crypto in general, is beyond your\ncurrent understanding, either ignore it, skim it and try to get the gist,\nor dig into the articles and books. \n\nAnyway, back to \"The Dining Cryptographers Problem: Unconditional Sender and\nRecipient Untraceability,\" David Chaum, Journal of Cryptology, I, 1, 1988.\nSince this journal is hard to get, I'll discuss the article in some detail.\n(The techniques have major implications for anarchocapitalism and for\nExtropian ideas.)\n\nAbstract: \"Keeping confidential who sends which messages, in a world where any \nphysical transmission can be traced to its origin, seems impossible.\nThe solution presented here is unconditionally or cryptographically secure,\ndepending on whether it is based on one-time-use keys or on public keys.\nrespectively. It can be adapted to address efficiently a wide variety of \npractical considerations.\"\n\nA word on terminology: \"Unconditionally secure\" means what it says: no\ncomputer will ever crack it. One-time pads are unconditionally secure...no\ncode or cipher is involved, except the one-time pad, so the message is\nsecure as long as the pad has not been compromised. \"Cryptographically\nsecure\" means secure so long as various crypto ciphers are secure, which\nmay be for a very, very long time (e.g., with very large primes, in RSA).\n\nChaum describes some \"dining cryptographers,\" which I will playfully change\nto \"dining Extropians.\" (The term is of course a variant of the seminal\n\"dining logicians problem\" in computer science)\n\nThree Extropians are having dinner, perhaps in New York City. Their waiter\ntells them that their bill has already been paid, either by the NSA\nor by one of them. The waiter won't say more.\n\nThe Extropians wish to know whether one of them paid, or the NSA paid. But\nthey don't want to be impolite and force the Extropina payer to 'fess up,\nso they carry out this protocol (or procedure):\n\nEach Extropian flips a fair coin behind a menu placed upright between himself\nand the Extropian on his right. The coin is visible to himself AND to the\nExtropian on his left. Each Extropian can see his own coin and the coin to his\nright.\n\nSTOP RIGHT HERE! Please take the time to make a sketch of the situation I've\ndescribed. If you lost it here, all that follows will be a blur. I'm sparing\nyou folks my attempt at an ASCII drawing!\n\nEach Extropians then states out loud whether the two coins he can see are the\nSAME or are DIFFERENT, e.g., \"Heads-Tails\" means DIFFERENT, and so forth. For\nnow, assume the Extropians are truthful.\n\nA little bit of thinking shows that the total number of \"DIFFERENCES\" must\nbe either 0 (the coins all came up the same), or 2. Odd parity is impossible.\n\nNow the Extropians agree that if one of them paid, he or she will SAY THE\nOPPOSITE of what they actually see. Remember, they don't announce what their\ncoin turned up as, only whether it was the same or different as their neighbor.\n\nSuppose none of them paid, i.e., the NSA paid. Then they all report the truth\nand the parity is even (either 0 or 2 differences). They then know the NSA\npaid.\n\nSuppose one of them paid the bill. He reports the opposite of what he actually\nsees, and the parity is suddenly odd. That is, there is 1 difference reported.\nThe Extropians now know that one of them paid. But can they determine which\none?\n\nSuppose you are one of the Extropians and you know you didn't pay. One of the\nother two did. You either reported SAME or DIFFERENT, based on what your \nneighbor to the right (whose coin you can see) had. But you can't tell which\nof the other two is lying! (You can see you right-hand neighbor's coin, but\nyou can't see the coin he sees to his right!)\n\nThis all generalizes to any number of people. If none of them paid, the parity\nis even. If one of them paid, the parity is odd. But which one of them paid\ncannot be deduced. And it should be clear that each round can transmit a bit,\ne.g., \"I paid\" is a \"1\". The message \"Attack at dawn\" could thus be \"sent\"\nuntraceably with multiple rounds of the protocol.\n\nThe Crypto Ouija Board: I explain this to people as a kind of ouija board.\nA message, like \"I paid\" or a more interesting \"Transfer funds from.....,\"\njust \"emerges\" out of the group, with no means of knowing where it came \nfrom. Truly astounding.\n\nNow there are many interesting wrinkles and elaborations to this protocol. I'll\nnote just a few.\n\n1. Collusion. Obviously the Extropians can collude to deduce the payer. \nThis is best dealt with by creating multiple subcircuits (groups doing the \nprotocol amongst themselves). Lots more stuff here. Chaum devotes most of the\npaper to these kind of issues and their solutions.\n\n2. With each round of this protocol, a single bit is transmitted. Sending\na long message means many coin flips. Instead of coins and menus, the \nneighbors would exchange lists of random numbers (with the right partners,\nas per the protocol above, of course. Details are easy to figure out.)\n\n3. Since the lists are essentially one-time pads, the protocol is \nunconditionally secure, i.e., no assumptions are made about the difficulty\nof factoring large numbers or any other crypto assumptions.\n\n4. Participants in such a \"DC-Net\" (and here we are coming to the heart\nof the \"crypto anarchy\" I have mentioned several times, and which is\nperhaps foolishly advertised in my .sig) could exchange CD-ROMs or DATs,\ngiving them enough \"coin flips\" for zillions of messages, all untraceable!\nThe logistics are not simple, but one can imagine personal devices, like\nsmart card or Apple \"Newtons,\" that can handle these protocols (early \napplications may be for untraceable brainstorming comments, secure\nvoting in corportate settings, etc.)\n\n5. The lists of random numbers (coin flips) can be generated with standard\ncryptographic methods, requiring only a key to be exchanged between the \nappropriate participants. This eliminates the need for the one-time pad,\nbut means the method is now only cryptographically secure, which is \noften sufficient. (Don't think \"only cryptographically secure\" means\ninsecure....the messages may remain encrypted for the next billion years)\n\n6. Collisions occur when multiple messages are sent at the same time. Various\nschemes can be devised to handle this, like backing off when you detect\nanother sender (when even parity is seen instead of odd parity). In large \nsystems this is likely to be a problem. Solutions are left as an exercise.\n\n7. Noise. Some participants may try to flood the circuit with spurious\nmessages, to defeat the system or for whatever other reasons. This is\nstill an issue. (If there's anything to take away from crypto, it's that\nnothing is as simple as it looks, that there are always devious ways to \nspoof, jam, and forge. I expect you've seen this from some of the debate\non digital voting schemes.)\n\nWhat Can \"DC-Net\" Be Used For?:\n\n* Untraceable mail. Useful for avoiding censorship, for avoiding lawsuits,\nand for all kinds of crypto anarchy things.\n\n* Fully anonymous bulletin boards, with no traceability of postings or \nresponses. Illegal materials can be offered for sale (my 1987 canonical\nexample, which freaked out a few people: \"Stealth bomber blueprints for\nsale. Post highest offer and include public key.\"). Think for a few minutes\nabout this and you'll see the profound implications.\n\n* Decentralized nexus of activity. Since messages \"emerge\" (a la the ouija\nboard metaphor), there is no central posting area. Nothing for the government\nto shut down, complete deniability by the participants.\n\n* Only you know who your a partners are....in any given circuit. And you can\nbe in as many circuits as you wish. (Payments can be made to others,\nto create a profit motive. I won't deal with this issue, or with the issue\nof how reputations are handled, in this posting.)\n\n* The tamper-responding \"digital mixes\" can still be useful, and may supplement\nthis purely software-based approach.\n\n* Digital money gets involved, too, both for payments in this system, and in\nterms of \"alternative currencies.\" I'm not an economist, so I'll leave this \nfor others to go into in more detail.\n\nEnough for now. Chaum's work is just the start. These systems can initially be\nset up for \"innocuous\" purposes like research into crypto techniques (not yet\nbanned in the U.S.), role-playing games, religions, and the like.

They used it as an upgrade in STU-III secure phones.  It's\nFederal Standard 1016.  It encodes voice at 4800 bits per second with\nbetter quality than any known algorithm under 16,000 bits per second\n(so says the paper on it).  If you give it 16 kbits/sec, it is \"toll\nquality\".\n\nYou can get a free copy of the standard, a \"technical information\nbulletin 92-1\" entitled \"Details to Assist in Implementation of Fed\nStandard 1016 CELP\", and four floppies full of C and Fortran software\nthat implements it, plus test cases, by requesting it from:\n\n\tOffice of the Manager\n\tNational Communications System\n\tAttn: NT\n\t701 S.

TTFN!\n\nWell,\n\nI intend for the communications themselves to encrypted as well.  This\nwould call for the remailing request to also somehow include Alice's\npublic key, and Bob's communications to include his public key, etc.\nThis will prevent intercepted mail from tampering and keep the\nanonimity.  .  Possibly the bank will have two public keys: one for\nmoney, and one for mail.\n\nHowever, in the initial phase to keep things simple, the messages\nwon't be encrypted - only the remailing info will.  This will\nimplement the anonymous part, and allow transactions, but will provide\nno protection against intercepting mail, etc.  Heck, the initial\nsystem will only allow withdrawals and deposits of a constant\ndenomination, so I'll worry about spoofing later :-)\n\nI'm operating under the premise of getting something out that is\nusable but not full blown.  So extra denominations, fully encrypted\nmessages, etc. will be added later.\n\nAlso, I received a mail from rjc@gnu.ai.mit.edu (Rob Crowley?) - whose\nmail I seem to have misplaced - voicing concern over proving deposits in\nthe event that the bank can't be trusted.  Any of the digital currency\nprotocol articles discuss this issue?  I guess I need to visit the\nlibrary again and do some more research, after finals.\n\n/-----------------------------------\\\n| Karl L.
